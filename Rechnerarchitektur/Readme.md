We are using the 2nd RISC-V edition of the book Computer Organization and Design by Hennessy and Patterson, published recently by Elsevier in 2021, for which there are also excellent slides from Elsevier available, which we copied for convenience. We have also produced PDFs. The book is highly recommended. We still need to see whether we are going to use all the material, add something or maybe extend some part. Thus the slide set will only be final at the end of the semester. We will also put lecture recordings and exercises here.

You find additional information about the course in ILIAS.
