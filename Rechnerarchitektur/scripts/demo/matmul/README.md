# matmul

Matrix multiplication as example following the Computer Organization and Design book for the Computer Architecture course.

The column major versions are more natural but slower.

The row major versions follow how Fortran would allocate two-dimensional arrays and run faster probably due to processors and compilers being forced to run fast on these legacy benchmarks.
