<!-- - `0:11:31`: yeah the. -->
<!-- - `0:11:34`: it just sort of stopped i mean. -->
<!-- - `0:11:38`: sorry about the place erase it. -->
- ![new_1](./_Computer-Architecture-Exercise-01-2022-10-27_imgs/new_00:11:40_0001.png)
<!-- - `0:11:41`: there is. -->
<!-- - `0:11:43`: there is a boy name which you have to restart every two days the days are over exploited on. -->
<!-- - `0:11:53`: now in the context of play i mean during the beijing so that opportunity and instruments but you don't want to have to dig my. -->
<!-- - `0:12:03`: doing why am i actually right. -->
<!-- - `0:12:06`: songs have to be careful about correctness. -->
<!-- - `0:12:11`: okay are some questionable for success. -->
<!-- - `0:12:15`: nope man in scores the second one. -->
<!-- - `0:12:21`: right. -->
<!-- - `0:12:27`: okay so jane. -->
<!-- - `0:12:33`: the oasis nice to program. -->
<!-- - `0:12:36`: which is due to the processors. -->
<!-- - `0:12:44`: okay. -->
<!-- - `0:12:45`: okay i figured that. -->
<!-- - `0:12:48`: roses server. -->
<!-- - `0:12:50`: which can divide the world while the other sisters. -->
<!-- - `0:12:56`: and then you basically delay the where and this worker takes one seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:13:02`: yeah processor and in the year it sucks. -->
<!-- - `0:13:08`: yeah but basically if you were your rules the more deliver the more useful. -->
- ![new_2](./_Computer-Architecture-Exercise-01-2022-10-27_imgs/new_00:13:13_0002.png)
<!-- - `0:13:16`: make sure that your number. -->
<!-- - `0:13:19`: and tourism differences wherever and then have divided and you will find that not the video is a generally divided vvd even thinks for a second. -->
<!-- - `0:13:32`: the complication the generally what the problem is water problems ridiculous. -->
<!-- - `0:13:44`: of each processor. -->
<!-- - `0:13:49`: each process. -->
<!-- - `0:13:52`: one of the key the one for each processor. -->
<!-- - `0:13:58`: so during the program that was given exercise. -->
<!-- - `0:14:03`: the computation time. -->
<!-- - `0:14:07`: the time. -->
<!-- - `0:14:11`: is. -->
<!-- - `0:14:13`: the time the the time for the remote the climate goals we do. -->
<!-- - `0:14:24`: the aerobic paradigm. -->
<!-- - `0:14:29`: which is why we often times he only wants. -->
<!-- - `0:14:33`: and before we have a greeting hated little behind the who. -->
<!-- - `0:14:39`: one. -->
<!-- - `0:14:41`: communicate who you want you and the bruins one of them. -->
<!-- - `0:14:46`: but we have laws. -->
<!-- - `0:14:53`: it would have only one processor the removal of mediation the process a process of a legal company gave me an otherwise it's. -->
# ==============0:15:00==============
<!-- - `0:15:06`: horton's ear. -->
<!-- - `0:15:10`: otherwise. -->
<!-- - `0:15:17`: the whole seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:15:20`: both of us. -->
<!-- - `0:15:23`: now what does this speed of him. -->
<!-- - `0:15:31`: the that is the ultimate admire the offer lives on. -->
<!-- - `0:15:45`: so the idea is either wouldn't either i wouldn't be speedup. -->
<!-- - `0:15:51`: the key from the local center. -->
<!-- - `0:15:55`: so it cannot. -->
<!-- - `0:15:57`: he would wear one of the attendants mustard. -->
<!-- - `0:16:05`: and was it. -->
<!-- - `0:16:07`: yeah and then you can be the ratio. -->
<!-- - `0:16:11`: rachel news. -->
<!-- - `0:16:15`: it is reddit. -->
<!-- - `0:16:17`: he pe reddit. -->
<!-- - `0:16:29`: or and then you have to do that or we have to move a good relation. -->
<!-- - `0:16:36`: in this case. -->
<!-- - `0:16:38`: when indications exercise and it's something which will end one thing i would teach everytime and he puts the mascara in the actual exam make sure that iteration still get your which means that issues filing. -->
<!-- - `0:16:54`: because you won't have the data available don't want to spend too much time trying to shake the arab which means that in that case the generator you will need will reduce the dangers everywhere or babies you have one. -->
<!-- - `0:17:17`: so processor. -->
<!-- - `0:17:23`: references. -->
<!-- - `0:17:26`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:17:35`: the racial. -->
<!-- - `0:17:41`: the one sister the one hundred second. -->
<!-- - `0:17:46`: which had been jailed for a year. -->
<!-- - `0:17:51`: we have all the facts on the moon. -->
<!-- - `0:17:58`: the what in our region will be bought. -->
<!-- - `0:18:03`: put on a second one. -->
<!-- - `0:18:07`: the amount of seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:18:12`: however when we have the webpage eight seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:18:17`: and the point is that true. -->
<!-- - `0:18:22`: the thieves. -->
<!-- - `0:18:31`: then the officers. -->
<!-- - `0:18:35`: the author of the time. -->
<!-- - `0:18:40`: when paul is twenty. -->
<!-- - `0:18:43`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:18:48`: for what. -->
<!-- - `0:18:52`: the er. -->
<!-- - `0:18:54`: on one year. -->
<!-- - `0:18:57`: who. -->
<!-- - `0:18:59`: or. -->
<!-- - `0:19:01`: your point in the region of the globe. -->
<!-- - `0:19:08`: the eggs and a waiter. -->
<!-- - `0:19:13`: refugees. -->
<!-- - `0:19:39`: wounded. -->
<!-- - `0:19:42`: and you. -->
<!-- - `0:19:51`: the original one actually will do the trick but all the remnants are awesome but all three other numbers but it doesn't. -->
# ==============0:20:00==============
<!-- - `0:20:04`: the witnesses submission to the will the the idea. -->
<!-- - `0:20:21`: the optimal either. -->
<!-- - `0:20:29`: which is good for scissors. -->
<!-- - `0:20:32`: instead of being rewarded for. -->
- `0:20:36`: dude you are not an optimist be the one i didn't actually realise that would actually mean **you would want a speedup of four but then you get a speedup of of 2.41**
<!-- - `0:20:51`: the dragon. -->
<!-- - `0:20:54`: his organic operation. -->
<!-- - `0:20:57`: then the. -->
<!-- - `0:21:02`: when the team wanted the myers lol. -->
<!-- - `0:21:11`: birmingham. -->
<!-- - `0:21:18`: catherine. -->
<!-- - `0:21:22`: noon. -->

<!-- - `0:22:22`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `0:22:24`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:22:45`: the one on him. -->
<!-- - `0:22:51`: the people are already removed the the validity of this one which probably would be the. -->
<!-- - `0:23:11`: anyway. -->
<!-- - `0:23:14`: always go to the next exercise. -->
<!-- - `0:23:17`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:23:37`: the exercise is about it brings in revenue within the rating. -->
<!-- - `0:23:57`: all the time. -->
<!-- - `0:24:01`: the prisons roaring. -->
<!-- - `0:24:05`: the moon. -->
<!-- - `0:24:09`: the way the documented instructions which are doing the works at once. -->
<!-- - `0:24:24`: and the first look at why do we allow the. -->
<!-- - `0:24:29`: what weight can be difficult the restriction of the prominent was the. -->
- **why do we have a extra cost of inctruction**
<!-- - `0:24:38`: what happens is that demanded you have a database which contains all the elements orleans the way you wanted it and then actually able to operate under the man. -->
<!-- - `0:24:58`: apparently that you will need some extra. -->
# ==============0:25:00==============
<!-- - `0:25:02`: operating who have the diamonds. -->
- ![new_5](./_Computer-Architecture-Exercise-01-2022-10-27_imgs/new_00:25:05_0006.png)
<!-- - `0:25:07`: in general the higher the when the then it would be abided by the operation and the operations the operation went to the man. -->
<!-- - `0:25:25`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:25:45`: the idea that the sections. -->
<!-- - `0:25:58`: the program. -->
<!-- - `0:26:05`: the program has. -->
<!-- - `0:26:10`: when he was a impressions. -->
<!-- - `0:26:13`: the and all the instructing the one factor which mean that behind when he was he one. -->
<!-- - `0:26:31`: when all the one hundred titles. -->
<!-- - `0:26:37`: which means that we divide the one. -->
<!-- - `0:26:42`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:26:52`: now a second program has. -->
<!-- - `0:26:55`: the twenty man. -->
<!-- - `0:27:02`: the man then the. -->
<!-- - `0:27:10`: the women. -->
<!-- - `0:27:15`: the website then we have the which gives the when the. -->

<!-- - `0:31:51`: and the wrong mirror. -->
<!-- - `0:31:55`: the index. -->
<!-- - `0:32:00`: the opening thirty in the program there was visible in asylum he cheated actually the process or the. -->
<!-- - `0:32:16`: the protest was a lot slower. -->
<!-- - `0:32:31`: which is why the change. -->
<!-- - `0:32:36`: the wound in the fire. -->
<!-- - `0:32:48`: but as the basically will resume. -->
<!-- - `0:33:07`: is that because our progress was slower than the destruction already made oprah was wrong. -->
<!-- - `0:33:13`: the wolverines by the end. -->
<!-- - `0:33:18`: and this isn't the one thing that is for example the inspiration for the lead. -->
<!-- - `0:33:30`: the kind of instruction where the tumble the fire the the coverletter with it they actually had the word. -->
<!-- - `0:33:48`: and now we the the implementation of an order he wasn't even actually the processor is reduced by one it is reduced to only one the pilot. -->
