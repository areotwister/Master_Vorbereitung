# ==============0:00:00==============
<!-- - `0:00:00`: the right. -->
<!-- - `0:00:06`: and if one person remote could tell me that you can read a urim that would be nice. -->
<!-- - `0:00:16`: so one person thank you very much. -->
<!-- - `0:00:20`: so. -->
<!-- - `0:00:22`: all leads to the soul. -->
<!-- - `0:00:27`: on tuesday. -->
<!-- - `0:00:30`: i'm uncomfortable junior isn't a virgin or maximum. -->
<!-- - `0:00:34`: the european are already basically regular computer and inwards and then improve results and basically will continue with what she was talking about namely. -->
<!-- - `0:00:50`: and yet so here the rest of the year. -->
<!-- - `0:00:55`: so if you look at what's happening inside a cpu you have this data pass which performs an algorithm of top. -->
<!-- - `0:01:03`: and if you look at the sentence you already see the two different things pepole the corporation so you're doing something and then fail. -->
<!-- - `0:01:11`: when you have data that mean that you have to access it somehow and iraq will perform some operations that to do something with it. -->
<!-- - `0:01:20`: but in terms of controlling the zeman said applies. -->
<!-- - `0:01:24`: and yet for basically wanting it loser which is out what's happening they can the controlled which is a sequence of data possibly of memory which basically tells his instructions mean get something from memory or do some operation. -->
<!-- - `0:01:42`: and if you look at the cpu you have already at the limit on cpu a very small memory. -->
<!-- - `0:01:49`: which is his pack. -->
<!-- - `0:01:50`: which is actually a category of best rum and it's them are important you get access for them so this is extremely fast memory but it costs a lot of money which is why we don't produce discs were basically and it is compared to a disk which is a thing which confused like this needs memory for keep the battery. -->
<!-- - `0:02:11`: which is why when dreams when you switch off your computer you lose all data which was in this richest which which was in his memory. -->
<!-- - `0:02:20`: now if we go back to our a twenty process. -->
- `0:02:24`: the big car with more guards and you can already see that the big cores are really bigger and more coarse and **one of the reason that they are bigger is that the big cores support more instructions than the small cores**.
- **the ddr logic is for memory**
- `0:02:45`: depends if he is needed the object of memory.
<!-- - `0:02:51`: and you can see on the river you know if you are a serious gamer appropriate an external view which you know. -->
<!-- - `0:03:02`: an extended gp you which performs much better but the show just during the song more names if you got an awkwardly matrix or just the ball moment where your career just couldn't work with us at night ready to do. -->
<!-- - `0:03:18`: and there is one thing more i want to point to which it is this should move on. -->
<!-- - `0:03:25`: so this year so technically this is for you which is best which is specialized into doing this machine learning things are possible as indication of an estimator but no everything will be ignored but by having a separate processor and punctual as hour and tooth. -->
<!-- - `0:03:45`: links direct yet consumed is taiwan which is especially important because it's quite a professor is on your topics which mean that consuming less power is definitely something you actually want to do. -->
<!-- - `0:04:01`: now yeah so you can see he is not already the biggest and yeah when you write a program you don't want to pay who paid kill every component of the things i mean you have to to some extent i made doing something in the union. -->
<!-- - `0:04:18`: asked the guy yeah you have to pay the program for random tribune but basically we tried to do obstruction obstruction in that it helps us deal with complexity. -->
<!-- - `0:04:31`: here in this hierarchy of complexity we just don't need to look at all the low level details. -->
<!-- - `0:04:39`: animation. -->
<!-- - `0:04:41`: for example near your mouth is memories big memory gear or the rammer from grub your visual system also has memory and if you write a program the way you usually don't care about where remember where things aren't installed to trust the program state. -->
# ==============0:05:00==============
<!-- - `0:05:01`: the process takes skill and things information ball around the invisibility or to put it in the other direction. -->
<!-- - `0:05:12`: so in terms of obstruction we yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:05:15`: i mean when you see this basically at the lowest standard what's odd is that you're about some elixir you'll have some extra electronic signals which are on and off and if you've ever written a program you know that don't work the level of opening of process opening song enter any sort of putting. -->
<!-- - `0:05:36`: neopoints overnight on home video would give those starting here is one or zero or something but just write something a little bit on the inevitable infrastructure then we'll use this instruction that architecture so what this is basically. -->
<!-- - `0:05:52`: this is the interface between the software the hardware and software. -->
<!-- - `0:05:56`: the britain. -->
- `0:05:58`: one year later he knows how to handle this this instruct this instructions and when you run the software you write directed his instructions or you write a program which gets translated into instructions **and because we use this instruction we're actually don't ahve to take care of every detail of which transistor is on or off**.
- `0:06:18`: which transistors of **this is basically handled by the hardware and you don't need to know much details about it**.
- `0:06:29`: yeah **and then you have one higher level of complexity which is still hardware** but then you have **system software interface**.
- `0:06:41`: and **so this abi** is so beside bizarre so when you write a program that usually **rely on standard libraries** that ivory for example you just you grab you you **ask the system to give you a memory and basically you're rely on the system to give you that memory** and you.
- `0:07:00`: **don't have to take care exactly about details** and at the **highest level** which are the most you as a **programmer working on** basically **is implementation**.
- `0:07:14`: and does **don't have to know exactly what's happening on top of it**.
<!-- - `0:07:22`: now let's talk a little bit of balls yeah so in terms of of. -->
<!-- - `0:07:29`: if we go back to this. -->
<!-- - `0:07:32`: yeah you go back with this weapon here but basically have to talk about things and it's fair spoke about. -->
<!-- - `0:07:39`: i always thought daytime. -->
<!-- - `0:07:43`: a different way to store data or to communicate and communicate data. -->
<!-- - `0:07:50`: in general the two different kinds of data are depressed one wanted one. -->
<!-- - `0:07:55`: so the idea is that it's one at a time which means that it loses it's strict i mean it's when you pull it off and it has power and accuses information. -->
- `0:08:05`: **this tends to be faster** than the second opponent which is number one time which means that you can switch off power and it's still there.
<!-- - `0:08:14`: however. -->
<!-- - `0:08:16`: it says it's faster but it's not there anymore which means that you will spawn to start a time or place where information can be retrieved later. -->
<!-- - `0:08:26`: no attacks because even if it's monetize to cook eat he bought a tie so there were talks of years ago where if you believe you put your cpu in the fridge you could at least theoretically be able to extract some information because it's all the time but it doesn't disappear immediately. -->
<!-- - `0:08:45`: and that's even if your portals so technically you could put it in the fridge and extract some information now this is probably not something that is important for you but if you are fearing an attack by someone who gets access to your computer this is something that is actually important. -->
<!-- - `0:09:03`: and then we have the ten version which i usually use a second memory so the point is that the cpu doesn't work directly with a number i mean when it's anything but frisco to go to divert different number time memory. -->
<!-- - `0:09:19`: magnetic disks which. -->
<!-- - `0:09:25`: yeah you've probably never seen. -->
<!-- - `0:09:28`: and then scratch memory which all the sitcoms and i'm thinking this means the means. -->
<!-- - `0:09:39`: which also plan is appearing now and replaced by yep. -->
<!-- - `0:09:43`: some. -->
<!-- - `0:09:45`: usb flash drives. -->
<!-- - `0:09:48`: which now. -->
<!-- - `0:09:50`: the that. -->
- `0:09:54`: now this is **this kind of memory is only local** suppose this is a memory that is basically painted in my laptop on the phone whatever you're using.
# ==============0:10:00==============
<!-- - `0:10:05`: for me and try to communicate this information so for example. -->
<!-- - `0:10:10`: you want to communicate it to over the internet or your virus version of it. -->
<!-- - `0:10:17`: this is too so the point is that you can communicate information from the outside you can get fired from the outside which are of resource sharing. -->
<!-- - `0:10:26`: but the yeah this for example the time of resource sharing for example to upload i just made earlier i mean the recording you saw earlier also an example of resource sharing and it's also true that laws will give you access to for example the university has computers you might want to look and even from another. -->
- ![new_1](./_Computer-Architecture-Chapter-1-2022-10-20-slide-17-to-46_imgs/new_00:10:27_0001.png)
<!-- - `0:10:46`: does that mean you need to also access the data which is not on this computer with another computer. -->
<!-- - `0:10:53`: so they're similar simple yet so here that several things you can do. -->
<!-- - `0:11:00`: you can do something purely to her or that part none of which is your neighbor as a caterer makes the water appear. -->
<!-- - `0:11:08`: yup. -->
<!-- - `0:11:10`: i probably won't give an alternate one isn't a letter and it's nuts i dunno. -->
<!-- - `0:11:18`: well maybe even the woman. -->
<!-- - `0:11:21`: i. -->
<!-- - `0:11:23`: also they're starting to slowly disappear right because i've talked to your home and you have no space anymore to put the ethernet cable so we need adapters for it. -->
<!-- - `0:11:32`: so i guess in a couple of years and the computer disappear. -->
<!-- - `0:11:36`: so basically this is the first and only logan so you can have a look at ekberg and this company which our basic needs connected to the computers and he wanted the books on white router which may give you access to wide area network within the internet. -->
<!-- - `0:11:55`: yeah you're on the internet. -->
<!-- - `0:11:59`: and so basically it gives you have the local things which communicate with the outside and when you send a packet outside it's coming the router and the router sending into the victim. -->
<!-- - `0:12:12`: and then yeah obviously we don't always escape into the open wireless network i mean the phones are gone or for your wifi. -->
<!-- - `0:12:23`: all your noodles is. -->
<!-- - `0:12:27`: the war soldier was one of the wifi. -->
<!-- - `0:12:32`: and but if consuming a small. -->
<!-- - `0:12:35`: so basically these are two different technologies which are advantageous and inconvenience. -->
<!-- - `0:12:42`: so yeah we have different different technology. -->
<!-- - `0:12:47`: and that changes who has dick pollution so we have generated two kinds of changes the first one is suddenly promotion. -->
<!-- - `0:12:57`: protocol switch the usb cables which. -->
<!-- - `0:13:01`: which are partially upgraded in a competent way at some point you also have changes in the protocol so if you look at wifi on wifi. -->
<!-- - `0:13:12`: the thing four point two four six i mean you'll have various versions of the photographs which usually you have. -->
<!-- - `0:13:20`: but you usually have the technology will allow us to bring bring wall data and transmits more data want to make it more reliable or have the capabilities especially we have this low energy bluetooth which with the idea that consumes less energy and then transmits a signal. -->
<!-- - `0:13:41`: would you probably know if you have a bluetooth headset. -->
<!-- - `0:13:45`: which is usually using stolen little energy boost because consumers born which is rid of rooms again if your company you're using the phone. -->
<!-- - `0:13:56`: and it should ever have issues with communication it's because it's a very it's something that hasn't really changed which is why that incompatibilities between searches. -->
<!-- - `0:14:08`: now we can't get over us are basically communicating to the outsides and we focus mostly on memory. -->
<!-- - `0:14:23`: basically memory has increased a lot now years of training on our memory you have a computer. -->
<!-- - `0:14:32`: if you're you compare your son with sixty game. -->
<!-- - `0:14:38`: i think the ottomans and yeah so there's this it'll look cool and the thing it's you're so i think bill gates said something along the lines of two hundred fifty six k member ram is basically wait to which we would never need that much memory. -->
<!-- - `0:14:56`: yeah i know six thinking that he got bites and it's tends to be increasing. -->
# ==============0:15:00==============
<!-- - `0:15:04`: i can actually see just the increase in terms of all sizes what's not better news actually that ignorant media has changed the lama robin fight. -->
<!-- - `0:15:17`: the media which came out this year renting. -->
<!-- - `0:15:22`: but basically there was also the pollution here and if you just look at the costs. -->
<!-- - `0:15:28`: yeah the crosby. -->
<!-- - `0:15:31`: learn and grow. -->
<!-- - `0:15:34`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:15:36`: so here you have the table which contains some information about color possible. -->
<!-- - `0:15:43`: while the staples. -->
<!-- - `0:15:45`: the fact you chose the baseline vacuum to chew is something that i have never seen you can see it in a museum the sometimes a piece basically it's big tube and it's something which can think. -->
<!-- - `0:16:04`: it could basically switch it could switch tension few thousand times. -->
<!-- - `0:16:11`: right so it could go from zero to one for one point zero of your problem and then you have to change it. -->
<!-- - `0:16:18`: now get a few thousand times lightsaber knots and then you just have to remember that your cpu is doing sara de liberation for seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:16:28`: so the nineteen fifties was probably enough but today it's just nuts it wouldn't work out and they seem to me that francisco was an advantage it's a bit of technology. -->
<!-- - `0:16:40`: and basically that revolutionize anything. -->
<!-- - `0:16:44`: already have this one thirty fire i mean it was thirty four directed by golems is thirty five from it's people and the second advantage is how does an infection through with something big and from the store or something very small. -->
<!-- - `0:16:59`: which we also have reduced the size so basically if you look at the ninety years. -->
<!-- - `0:17:04`: her computer was several rooms bigger. -->
<!-- - `0:17:08`: and now i see my netbook hear a purple dress on. -->
<!-- - `0:17:14`: and sonia wasn't benefit then reminded you of buying from the visitors. -->
<!-- - `0:17:21`: and the bakery and then we just gave up and then the clones the ones with two hundred billion. -->
<!-- - `0:17:31`: one thing to remember matter which is very which i think is a pitcher. -->
<!-- - `0:17:37`: a better information about all things we've all. -->
<!-- - `0:17:41`: this is remember that when the apollo program was launched with computers which at this point was on my phone. -->
<!-- - `0:17:49`: and i have a platform. -->
<!-- - `0:17:52`: was local so yeah they're some of the management of all the nations on this computers and then we just saw yet today it would take you less time. -->
<!-- - `0:18:04`: producing transportation. -->
<!-- - `0:18:08`: ooh that became cycle. -->
<!-- - `0:18:14`: your viewpoints and i think that's the wrong thing. -->
<!-- - `0:18:20`: yeah not what i wanted yet one thing to realize is that if you compare this graph. -->
<!-- - `0:18:27`: two. -->
<!-- - `0:18:29`: moore's small. -->
<!-- - `0:18:32`: okay. -->
<!-- - `0:18:34`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:18:37`: pool. -->
<!-- - `0:18:38`: uber for basic needs this is also it's. -->
<!-- - `0:18:43`: also explanation. -->
<!-- - `0:18:46`: then the people that. -->
<!-- - `0:18:51`: no. -->
<!-- - `0:18:53`: booking. -->
<!-- - `0:18:55`: then it's cuba. -->
<!-- - `0:19:02`: hm hm. -->
<!-- - `0:19:11`: go. -->
<!-- - `0:19:16`: but they skipped the accidental it was later insistence the stages that sorry. -->
<!-- - `0:19:28`: the memory of class on board a lot but it's become a lot faster but it hasn't caught up with i'll probably do computations. -->
<!-- - `0:19:39`: which means that over time memory has become a lot more costly for i mean you should do one operation we cannot do a lot fewer memory exorcism in the past. -->
<!-- - `0:19:53`: now back to the transistor. -->
- ![new_2](./_Computer-Architecture-Chapter-1-2022-10-20-slide-17-to-46_imgs/new_00:19:55_0002.png)
<!-- - `0:19:56`: i. -->
<!-- - `0:19:59`: yes so we have this. -->
# ==============0:20:00==============
<!-- - `0:20:03`: i mean this is funny cause the technology is worse about the money and it's even more worth more because we have one and it's largely in taiwan and you know that there is one. -->
<!-- - `0:20:17`: what did you condition the between taiwan and china have a slightly different opinion on whether taiwan is a separate country or not. -->
<!-- - `0:20:28`: so basically if. -->
<!-- - `0:20:31`: yeah if there is a war basically the semiconductor technology would just probably disappeared somebody. -->
<!-- - `0:20:39`: and that's why partially all this coming conduct the industry is trying to womb and it's been broke away from that building tops in virus other countries. -->
<!-- - `0:20:51`: not if you look at the eggs and for the record with typical witches and then it comes back separate the very small ones are very small transistors. -->
- `0:21:05`: now it's a little bit more complicated than that because he would have considered i mean between two city containers octopus song i mean certainly between two transistors and the transistors on silicon but **between two transistors you're going to have some conductors when you want to transmit information**.
<!-- - `0:21:25`: i mean if you look back at the plots. -->
<!-- - `0:21:29`: if your muscle memory you're mentioning the excess yeah you're horrible to have it isn't a conductor. -->
<!-- - `0:21:37`: and within them districts which is semi conductor behaving this way. -->
<!-- - `0:21:45`: and islamic center of which is to be able to activate the gear to make pots. -->
<!-- - `0:21:54`: and yeah big shot so one. -->
<!-- - `0:22:01`: if you go back to this slide here. -->
<!-- - `0:22:07`: you can i mean this is ignite the desire. -->
<!-- - `0:22:12`: you obviously would actually die and he used to make listeners torture he wouldn't be able to follow because businesses look for tracking. -->
<!-- - `0:22:23`: both of these things means that the financial goals of the night which i think is. -->
<!-- - `0:22:32`: rapid moon phases is awesome. -->
<!-- - `0:22:37`: and so you haven't been actually getting the dogfight away from of the limit you can actually reach but we would like to make it smaller and making it smaller it's actually in your huge challenge because at some point or something or one of physics which the two wires. -->
<!-- - `0:22:56`: we are very close. -->
<!-- - `0:22:59`: at some point in the relationship might cause chemical. -->
<!-- - `0:23:05`: you have to put your skills will gather some information on them. -->
<!-- - `0:23:11`: and this is something you don't know how to handle at so we don't like that this is an image of them all small we can make things. -->
<!-- - `0:23:22`: i mean this isn't an issue the issue is something we're talking about for i mean people are talking about for twenty years or something but apparently it's i mean we have the first cpu as which are printed up three hundred meters so it seems to work out. -->
<!-- - `0:23:39`: but at some point i think below one other major interest the cycle from this or it just doesn't work anymore physics tell you that this is going to work at least not with silicon. -->
<!-- - `0:23:54`: now let's talk a little bit about the manufactured silicones. -->
<!-- - `0:23:59`: so you stop being cynical. -->
<!-- - `0:24:03`: then slice or something small a little bit and then the wafer. -->
<!-- - `0:24:08`: the wafer is managed through the appearance. -->
<!-- - `0:24:13`: when you have a small processing space then you get the yeah some patterns when it because they perceived the weight problem as it goes. -->
<!-- - `0:24:24`: wait for the one. -->
<!-- - `0:24:28`: so basically this is wrong he never really made the redbird basically able to produce five hundred kids with the game and each year the year and the worship. -->
<!-- - `0:24:47`: when you were there when you have been spending. -->
<!-- - `0:24:53`: yes for visiting golden rule. -->
<!-- - `0:24:57`: repair privileges. -->
# ==============0:25:00==============
<!-- - `0:25:01`: festival or the which because during the spring thing is pretty nice extremely complicated i mean. -->
<!-- - `0:25:10`: there's a building or reading factory any new or reducing the size of the waiters from the next thing the scorpions are definitely been demoted. -->
<!-- - `0:25:22`: it's not something that you can just try out and just consider the money and then move on because all the plans you will discover that so all the way to go. -->
<!-- - `0:25:36`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:25:38`: for whatever reason they might because this is printed in in the vacuum on your vacuum maybe it was the october oxygen or something thats just a broken system. -->
<!-- - `0:25:52`: right and then you know which one the way the prince dies. -->
<!-- - `0:25:59`: it and then contribute to the testing particularly china. -->
<!-- - `0:26:05`: because i mean we go back to those if you look at the images here you'll have one parent who doesn't work. -->
<!-- - `0:26:14`: you have so many caledon hockley as every part of technology advocate you cannot just advocate but you try to test at least enough to find which ones don't work. -->
<!-- - `0:26:24`: one trade which is solid pins or. -->
<!-- - `0:26:28`: i some pictures. -->
<!-- - `0:26:32`: that actually prints that said eight course i remember that as a discomfort to those were interesting senator he wasn't six corrosion. -->
<!-- - `0:26:45`: i'm basically it works out you can just get refined writes it's basic that you produced it otherwise he would have to throw it away. -->
<!-- - `0:26:57`: now you can eat this wafer. -->
<!-- - `0:27:04`: i'm pretty sure that this is basically the old ne isn't a picture i guess interested public but i think every and he was things about august is printed then basically become trademark informational information that into whatever it printing interest. -->
<!-- - `0:27:21`: don't want to tell you. -->
<!-- - `0:27:25`: and there is a. -->
<!-- - `0:27:27`: and so we talked about the rape of all things. -->
<!-- - `0:27:32`: vistas between us the inflammation. -->
<!-- - `0:27:36`: the cost is basic needs the cost of a waiter divided by how many. -->
<!-- - `0:27:43`: how many guys can put on the weight will depend on you but basically you have it on awake or putting his own picture where there were five hundred and six five minute wait for a five hundred and six the work and basically the cost of one guy. -->
<!-- - `0:28:03`: the cost of living. -->
<!-- - `0:28:09`: yeah well then you have the power to wake her and revenue raiser every day every hour this is not completely true because the problem has been wrong. -->
<!-- - `0:28:21`: for the hawks on the year. -->
- `0:28:24`: and then back to the millions one divided by the area and everyone for **one important to realize is that it's square in the area of the die** between the bigger you'll have to make them bigger.
<!-- - `0:28:44`: chip a bigger you actually need you in the heat of your big ultimates. -->
<!-- - `0:28:52`: so in general the weight of cost in the area offices you have decided designer should be a certain way so let's make the texts and then the big factors determine the process and this is basically what they're trying to bring. -->
<!-- - `0:29:10`: cool. -->
<!-- - `0:29:13`: yeah it's an arrogant turn by the service record designer. -->
<!-- - `0:29:18`: so it's a circuit design and most morning wanted to be surprised. -->
<!-- - `0:29:24`: most cpu was no odds something like eleven other majors the second one is the one in your phone that might even be seven depending shop a reasonable lot but basically in your college student movie or like fifteen inches or something because human. -->
<!-- - `0:29:42`: a car is big enough that you don't care so much about saving to send to send you to someone always on spacebar emotion portion. -->
<!-- - `0:29:58`: yeah i think that the eu is not something i don't know any number of things and i'm pretty sure that that's an oldest industry would not give you any information about defeat. -->
# ==============0:30:00==============
<!-- - `0:30:15`: one interesting question is okay now how big the moon is that. -->
<!-- - `0:30:22`: you live the wrong. -->
<!-- - `0:30:28`: yes so it's usually misses spending nights. -->
<!-- - `0:30:33`: and a spotlight on these reasons even when which easier to do so wrong with lenses and so basically it's wrong. -->
<!-- - `0:30:45`: so that's why it's wrong. -->
<!-- - `0:30:48`: but yeah it's a good place for miami would make sense of people chips and bits of his year or something pretense somehow doesn't mean someone somehow because you have immense because it doesn't work. -->
<!-- - `0:31:04`: okay so normally has a cpu. -->
<!-- - `0:31:08`: anyone can try to talk about performance. -->
<!-- - `0:31:15`: yeah the first thing. -->
<!-- - `0:31:23`: yeah okay so the first example of this year which is from the sides so basically it's a question how do we find their phones okay but here they give an example rich amin doesn't buy for basically your name and then they come here for the birth. -->
<!-- - `0:31:39`: which isn't a capacity of all of the ball the scheme and the precedent so big basically among people over eighteen. -->
- `0:31:51`: and basically everything to be wanted isn't winning for each category so you have a concord with the mostest but somehow it is that he was both interesting and adequately wouldn't go that far so we have different measures and then the **question is how do we compare them**.
- `0:32:12`: and basically **we have something similar for cpus**.
<!-- - `0:32:20`: let me show you an example. -->
<!-- - `0:32:23`: most nods. -->
<!-- - `0:32:28`: your. -->
<!-- - `0:32:33`: well for him actually he was my computer to my computer in my office so like we don't have interactions between zoom anywhere from here. -->
<!-- - `0:32:47`: so you'll probably all know matrix multiplication. -->
<!-- - `0:32:55`: in the most. -->
<!-- - `0:32:58`: i mean it wasn't as if was recently the. -->
<!-- - `0:33:05`: so here you can see the algorithm of the vacation return the people ropes and then it's the result of as given by this fallen on. -->
<!-- - `0:33:15`: no i think sneakers are basically the complexity of it is it's cubing. -->
<!-- - `0:33:26`: and the traditionalists are people we have every big thing that fact actually review was actually written on complex it's over. -->
<!-- - `0:33:40`: so. -->
<!-- - `0:33:43`: the typical way the neighbors. -->
<!-- - `0:33:48`: and then anybody in the boathouse. -->
<!-- - `0:33:57`: hey. -->
<!-- - `0:34:05`: no they basically wanted engage with the nation we have you have the one thing to notice is that my presence. -->
<!-- - `0:34:18`: the matrix. -->
- `0:34:23`: but what people aggravate me know whether **they consider matrix addition to be constant time** but my kitchen big.
<!-- - `0:34:35`: and so there is a way to reduce this exposure through. -->
<!-- - `0:34:40`: the aggressive awesome which gives you two points or seven eight. -->
<!-- - `0:34:53`: the whole thing and then i mean in recent years it was a rush to reduce the number. -->
# ==============0:35:00==============
<!-- - `0:35:00`: something inside us more specific. -->
<!-- - `0:35:03`: i think the record is up two point seven one. -->
<!-- - `0:35:07`: no not this is was basically an archetypal one set of acres becomes mostly a bunch of dishes because. -->
<!-- - `0:35:19`: the author is improved and then the first book was the best one a lot of us other legs and so basically the coffin the constant which is hidden always bristol bay got accepted to my tricks has said something about the size of the universe really devastating diseases. -->
<!-- - `0:35:39`: it was recently in the news because of his project by google are basically the application or specify the size. -->
<!-- - `0:35:53`: the general. -->
<!-- - `0:35:55`: checking his butt. -->
<!-- - `0:35:57`: your responses are just better than the others inside and basically drinking something better but it has been said differently in the basic bihar they say one hundred million. -->
<!-- - `0:36:11`: what's interesting about this a few days later song. -->
<!-- - `0:36:16`: the uniform some of it is actually my next or even just the food. -->
<!-- - `0:36:24`: well then managed to get one with vivid was rendered against nobody. -->
<!-- - `0:36:29`: one thing to. -->
<!-- - `0:36:32`: yeah one thing at once in the capable hands of a way that basically meant motivation but what what if he was actually would have prevented engine. -->
<!-- - `0:36:42`: and basically when i was visiting assumption on the operator they would follow the book of the ball. -->
<!-- - `0:36:52`: no. -->
<!-- - `0:36:54`: the trusts. -->
<!-- - `0:36:57`: so in this class we are not going to talk about how to improve algorithm. -->
<!-- - `0:37:02`: we are talking about wallet. -->
<!-- - `0:37:05`: and what goes on. -->
<!-- - `0:37:11`: he was robbed. -->
<!-- - `0:37:17`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `0:37:20`: so basically a dedicated example is that we'd be running reading books with jacqueline. -->
<!-- - `0:37:27`: and we refill usb those in the first type of basically this is the one and then already grew up at bowling for the same reason and we make it important for cosmos. -->
<!-- - `0:37:43`: i want to be clear this is basically using the same diversity we have over our complexity of end to the policy but because we do home we'd have basically been operating the better or produced because functions we actually get the solution which performance. -->
<!-- - `0:38:03`: huge improvement in performance. -->
<!-- - `0:38:11`: no i can try music you want. -->
<!-- - `0:38:17`: but here you can see the python program. -->
<!-- - `0:38:20`: we figured it was a random number. -->
<!-- - `0:38:23`: and then the vacation. -->
<!-- - `0:38:27`: and this has size two hundred and fourteen. -->
<!-- - `0:38:31`: no. -->
<!-- - `0:38:35`: this one year. -->
<!-- - `0:38:40`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `0:38:43`: those are big time. -->
<!-- - `0:38:51`: okay. -->
<!-- - `0:38:53`: really cool what this means and then he said he was nice but basically we just did the program and that program over. -->
<!-- - `0:39:04`: one point one point to me at one point eight seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:39:10`: well this is a base version we just found the site then actually we can try to do something a bit better namely we can write rewrite our program in c. -->
<!-- - `0:39:24`: so it. -->
<!-- - `0:39:25`: if the exact same program exactly on the heels. -->
<!-- - `0:39:30`: oh areas and individual vacation and here again in the village was run the numbers. -->
<!-- - `0:39:38`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:39:47`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:39:52`: and i can execute it. -->
<!-- - `0:39:55`: so basically know how to program and then i mean the program itself. -->
# ==============0:40:00==============
<!-- - `0:40:01`: the tourism is in demand and basically then you're the year but just know this from station one. -->
<!-- - `0:40:13`: the open minded anything where we go for the seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:40:19`: now let's ask the compiler to optimize events. -->
<!-- - `0:40:24`: important the twenty seconds of zero point four seconds with mirror on two seconds. -->
<!-- - `0:40:32`: and if i ask you to optimize the war with europa zero nine cycle. -->
<!-- - `0:40:40`: and at the highest level of motivation we don't see a difference anymore. -->
<!-- - `0:40:47`: i think if. -->
<!-- - `0:40:51`: if thinking different change the time. -->
<!-- - `0:40:58`: the changing size will receive difference between the moons. -->
<!-- - `0:41:05`: hooper. -->
<!-- - `0:41:17`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `0:41:20`: but basically now we have made our mattresses twice a dollar and remember twice as loud humming eight times more operations to pull through. -->
<!-- - `0:41:37`: he goes in between. -->
<!-- - `0:41:40`: then. -->
<!-- - `0:41:43`: the between the level of the sensation. -->
<!-- - `0:41:52`: produces anyway so basically we have all this information and yeah you can see here that. -->
<!-- - `0:42:01`: i think we have the same algorithm have used different levels of optimization which use slightly different features of hardware. -->
<!-- - `0:42:09`: and we got a huge huge performance improvements. -->
<!-- - `0:42:17`: and basically we will talk about poker make us even better the nick chubb in the next next chapters. -->
<!-- - `0:42:26`: now let's go back to that. -->
<!-- - `0:42:31`: this. -->
<!-- - `0:42:35`: we're here. -->
<!-- - `0:42:37`: okay. -->
<!-- - `0:42:44`: oh yeah can. -->
<!-- - `0:42:51`: yeah let me show you. -->
<!-- - `0:42:53`: it's one of amin's favorite examples. -->
<!-- - `0:43:14`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `0:43:35`: okay so this is a more competent this is a more complicated example. -->
<!-- - `0:43:42`: right so i mentioned before that as i mentioned before that memory hasn't caught up with a very basic in the thousands of imposter but the memory of says it all. -->
<!-- - `0:43:55`: and basically so this is code written by. -->
<!-- - `0:43:58`: and the idea that you want overtime. -->
<!-- - `0:44:01`: the question is vulgar your best woman. -->
- `0:44:05`: and actually you want to move on an even better one time that you want to find a new wave the one to estimate the pint in a way that if you run the bicycle of the same time which is something trying something but what actually does is to **estimate the number**.
- `0:44:24`: **of memory acceses**.
<!-- - `0:44:29`: instead of trying to really motivate them and that way it gets the venue which is neither of the clothes that doesn't depend on what cpd was actually doing. -->
<!-- - `0:44:48`: yeah so if you look at what's your. -->
<!-- - `0:44:52`: the violence. -->
<!-- - `0:44:56`: you will have elapsed. -->
<!-- - `0:44:58`: just how much fun is boring. -->
# ==============0:45:00==============
<!-- - `0:45:04`: and then you have the system timer which is actually the portal to the system especially when your oscar river in the uk it's just it's it's pocket spot on the system time because he just asks the exploitation yet you ask him that the phoenix that gives you. -->
<!-- - `0:45:22`: a memory and that's a common system time. -->
<!-- - `0:45:25`: which is insult mine is this way i mean that's not going to ever even depend on the future. -->
<!-- - `0:45:31`: and you. -->
<!-- - `0:45:36`: he hasn't got squats but basically the cpu was oily was only when the one closest to my computer was like what the fuck. -->
<!-- - `0:45:46`: the computer might have interrupted the process of the weight not only is the editor might just be asked to i mean central database or examples. -->
<!-- - `0:45:58`: which is why time is a measurement and for example the cache access is a better version. -->
<!-- - `0:46:11`: right so. -->
<!-- - `0:46:15`: well this i mean this version so this was the prevention of islam concussion is something which is. -->
<!-- - `0:46:23`: which is a better example than this guys basically be good and actually we would talk in the next chapters a bit more about the cash in this way then you will understand better why repercussions is. -->
<!-- - `0:46:37`: no. -->
<!-- - `0:46:38`: if you measure response time and. -->
<!-- - `0:46:46`: if you want to go about this if he was going to wake up the when the response is the boss and the snowboard is how many. -->
<!-- - `0:46:58`: the dollar. -->
<!-- - `0:47:03`: just like the year. -->
<!-- - `0:47:07`: if i want to shoot through central north of dayton. -->
<!-- - `0:47:11`: if i want to send you side for example. -->
<!-- - `0:47:16`: it send you it over the internets it would probably yeah i mean it would take a certain amount of time. -->
<!-- - `0:47:25`: well the reason i mean we're just let's say that let's say that you have a one gigabytes stable connection the first one percent gigabytes and basically the particular setting but we have a response time of one second. -->
- `0:47:40`: in basic rules i mean yeah it's the most lucre seconds now if **if i send you a truck of hard drives**.
<!-- - `0:47:52`: the trucks were properties we'd take let's say two days to get to you. -->
- `0:47:58`: so you would have a **response time of two days** but you could **put in a lot of hard drives** which means that we're **actually sendind a lot of data** properly and not smoke would have been able to send to you just over the internet.
- `0:48:11`: and so there's a **difference between response time and throughput** i mean if i send you every day and you will get nothing about the books i mean lots of data so basically once you're sold the **cost of sending a truck is that you have to wait two days the first day but then they're just come every day**.
<!-- - `0:48:27`: until this is what happens this is what marks an important distinction between the response time and movie. -->
<!-- - `0:48:37`: so what happens if you will check i mean what happens risk of time to smoke or to replace a call system with a passover. -->
<!-- - `0:48:46`: but if you're if your processes oscar. -->
<!-- - `0:48:50`: do a combination. -->
<!-- - `0:48:55`: what what is changing. -->
<!-- - `0:48:58`: anyone have an idea. -->
- `0:49:06`: so basically **if your cpu is faster...**.
- `0:49:10`: the time it takes.
- `0:49:16`: to do a task will become more done for example just imagine that because you have a boston cpu takes **one second instead of minute** would be able to walk it would mean that you'd be **able to do more work**.
- `0:49:31`: now **if we more processors...** not familiar with that way of thinking about it but just **imagine that i facebook or google add more servers** which will increase in the servers what would have happened.
- `0:49:47`: when the **response time won't change** because it **still takes the same amount of time for the information being processed** but the **throughput will increase...**.
# ==============0:50:00==============
<!-- - `0:50:03`: at the end of the next cycle the focus on response time. -->
<!-- - `0:50:12`: instead of ouput. -->
<!-- - `0:50:17`: no. -->
- ![new_3](./_Computer-Architecture-Chapter-1-2022-10-20-slide-17-to-46_imgs/new_00:50:19_0003.png)
<!-- - `0:50:21`: yeah but basically we didn't want the whole of us to one decided by the fighter. -->
- `0:50:28`: **if you think of a cpu...**.
<!-- - `0:50:32`: quite a bit of a cpu. -->
<!-- - `0:50:37`: the ravens of the pilot. -->
- **you have a frequence of 5 GHz**
- **and basically this is the performance and 5GHz means 5 billions operations per second**
<!-- - `0:50:43`: he got ads and basic games the organs and the product begins. -->
<!-- - `0:50:50`: operation are saying where you have also has protected you. -->
- `0:50:57`: and **when you want to compare two programs or two computers** and you **say that x is 10 times fatser than y basically you compare the ratio of performance**.
<!-- - `0:51:10`: which is very similar to. -->
- `0:51:15`: **which is just the same of comparing...** gonna be binding the contents **executin times?**.
<!-- - `0:51:21`: so let's see that on the exam group which is given on the science page. -->
<!-- - `0:51:25`: someone got a program that expects things to prevent an infected being we divide the institution finally could do that as one one times one the pasta be. -->
<!-- - `0:51:50`: no this basic basically. -->
<!-- - `0:51:53`: so this basic image removed from time. -->
- `0:51:57`: this is basically the program but **in practice...** probably the actual program.
- `0:52:03`: **it's more complicated than that** because the final four hundred pixels to run the program dependent on the brooklyn respond to the point where depending on what the process is all the overhead systems maybe the computers to get idea where the customer he was alive at the time.
<!-- - `0:52:22`: because it's all baby things for us to reduce the little things at the same time and basically it's all about the elapsed finance the opponents and basically all the aspects here it's because our oldest aspects it's very large compared to the times i mean you rarely. -->
<!-- - `0:52:42`: he thinks he could probably have just the fittings. -->
<!-- - `0:52:46`: if you open your browser settings might have brought on wednesday. -->
- `0:52:55`: and then once maybe i've heard of in the way of **cpu time...** which is part of the fun.
<!-- - `0:53:05`: i. -->
<!-- - `0:53:08`: the basic needs is a kind of spent by the process on the job this basically doesn't include in the irishman. -->
- `0:53:19`: so **it doesn't include idle time** on which he ended june one way to recover the bonds and it doesn't include all the drop spot if the cpu has to be inter.
<!-- - `0:53:34`: he has been talked about before. -->
<!-- - `0:53:40`: yeah so now let's talk her to the balls about what crimes mean and prosecuting work the traveling. -->
<!-- - `0:53:48`: so basically they have a carrier so endless cpu or cpu fracturing and basically did crooked spending okay the funding. -->
<!-- - `0:53:59`: not all. -->
<!-- - `0:54:01`: cool. -->
<!-- - `0:54:05`: it look cause cpu from very far away. -->
<!-- - `0:54:11`: new router. -->
<!-- - `0:54:15`: we're just giving them. -->
<!-- - `0:54:17`: nevada. -->
<!-- - `0:54:23`: richard. -->
<!-- - `0:54:27`: the targeting states. -->
<!-- - `0:54:36`: and then when our nation. -->
<!-- - `0:54:39`: the mixed finances. -->
- `0:54:46`: **basically every time the clock ticks, it's ging up we start the calculation for the next state...** and then i imagine it's been the same.the cards
# ==============0:55:00==============
<!-- - `0:55:03`: every everytime would probably. -->
<!-- - `0:55:06`: we started the traditional next state. -->
<!-- - `0:55:09`: then. -->
<!-- - `0:55:11`: at the end of the calculation it must be finished and it must be spoiling these space. -->
<!-- - `0:55:19`: because he isn't basically. -->
- `0:55:24`: you piss your **cheating in the sense that shortly before the clock time the next state has to be stored in the state**.
<!-- - `0:55:33`: this is basically us nice reading my spoons. -->
<!-- - `0:55:40`: so basically around the time my initial ended muslim stork the preparation. -->
<!-- - `0:55:50`: he read years of reputation of the temperature tends to relax in the direction of the clock cycle. -->
<!-- - `0:55:57`: gauntlet of two hundred typical seconds which means that the switch every twenty five seconds the panthers are polar minus twins. -->
<!-- - `0:56:08`: and then the drop frequency is the number of seconds in the bowl. -->
- `0:56:15`: the **one divided two hundred fifty** which the other four times depending on.
<!-- - `0:56:26`: now if you are wondering okay what was up here but at least it resume into the games. -->
<!-- - `0:56:35`: this is the recognition on different gates without good for the immigration. -->
<!-- - `0:56:46`: facing the nation is a sign that it's time that the election the electronic signal needs to get stomped. -->
<!-- - `0:56:55`: finish the invasion. -->
<!-- - `0:56:58`: so let me insights. -->
<!-- - `0:57:03`: yeah it's just it's not sufficient will just speed up the growth rate the limited by the foundational states. -->
<!-- - `0:57:12`: otherwise we'll get into reuse federal minimum wage at home partially cultivated besides for something that doesn't make so much sense anymore. -->
- `0:57:27`: **clock frequency must be large enough to finish all the calculations**.
<!-- - `0:57:37`: you. -->
<!-- - `0:57:40`: yeah we talk a little bit and we can slightly work around it sometimes but i say you're actually in that case i need to pre-rinse through the divisions basis so basically potato came here you should wait so what's really want to do next has to wait. -->
<!-- - `0:58:00`: but that's basically order can do i mean if you watch on. -->
<!-- - `0:58:06`: yesterday he wasn't impatient is not the goal the next thing i know cpu is limited private school. -->
<!-- - `0:58:18`: now we can look wednesday. -->
<!-- - `0:58:21`: he can just do a of all of them. -->
<!-- - `0:58:25`: how much trouble the most corrupt cyclists. -->
<!-- - `0:58:30`: so basically the cpu time is the number of cyclists little sci-fi cycle timer so it's a new crop cycle the rates. -->
<!-- - `0:58:43`: and. -->
- `0:58:45`: yeah so basically **if you want to improve the cpu time there are several ways to do it**.
<!-- - `0:58:53`: it can reduce the number of cycles which means making the program better. -->
<!-- - `0:58:58`: this is basically an example of my picks for deprecation alexander reciprocation the comparison between all zero mean with zero and just bought them towards basically reduce the number of cycles needed to be got across the program. -->
- `0:59:15`: we can **increase the clock rate**.
- `0:59:18`: **at least until the hardware fits i mean until you don't manage the manipulation? in time anymore**.
<!-- - `0:59:25`: and in practice this is usually the video. -->
<!-- - `0:59:30`: not tradable go in cycles. -->
<!-- - `0:59:36`: there is so neat way to your i mean if i've ever heard about. -->
<!-- - `0:59:42`: oh. -->
- `0:59:45`: what can boost the newspaper but basically **in the cpus you buy in your computer you can to some extent increase performance by increasing the voltage and reducing the clock time**.
<!-- - `0:59:59`: so that way you get to pick some overhauls ultimates usually at the cost of an opponent. -->
# ==============1:00:00==============
<!-- - `1:00:09`: now let's let's get to cpu time and again do some calculations. -->
<!-- - `1:00:19`: i have to chip in with this business produce officer doing something strange but anyway so basically here we want to. -->
- `1:00:27`: we have a computer which is running would you go ahead truck time and we have ten seconds to pew time and actually we **want to make a computer that is fourty percent faster**.
<!-- - `1:00:40`: the however big. -->
- `1:00:44`: **we do a faster clock with our clock cyles we can become slower**. **then we can calculate our clock rate and compare it**.
- `1:00:55`: and then we conclude that **we have**.
- `1:01:01`: **to make our computer twice as fast to get a fourty percent increase** of these.
- `1:01:06`: when you would kind of hope that they would get the body was there any upcoming autumns and busted **actually there is a factor two because of the cost of changing clock cycle seconds**.
<!-- - `1:01:20`: and we will do more more calculation exciting exercises next week. -->
- `1:01:27`: now this is a slightly skewed i mean this is a **measure of clock cycles** but we can **actually try to do something more precise which is to count the number of instructions** wrong.
<!-- - `1:01:40`: but it grew back with his blood crazy and one instruction the years of instruction. -->
- `1:01:48`: and **basically going for instructions mean that we can also compare instructins if you take two? cycles**.
<!-- - `1:01:57`: so we huddle. -->
<!-- - `1:02:00`: the view is mine is inspection **clocks per instruction**. -->
<!-- - `1:02:06`: the. -->
<!-- - `1:02:10`: the instructional program by the program. -->
<!-- - `1:02:16`: yeah it's. -->
<!-- - `1:02:18`: but considering it's the around the language and eleven. -->
<!-- - `1:02:25`: was in every song from all the versions this is one of the reason why the vacationing public adjusters and one of the trainees unchanged that tweet the tweet is a bitch to get instruction which to say. -->
<!-- - `1:02:45`: the everything. -->
- `1:02:47`: the **basically the instruction count is given** wizards not on the table.
<!-- - `1:02:54`: now the average sacred ritual the most i can. -->
<!-- - `1:02:59`: i you for. -->
<!-- - `1:03:01`: you can your inspection home i mean young one hundred and something an instruction connection paid seven cited was not deserted only one. -->
<!-- - `1:03:11`: so now that an average cycle construction is determined person by the unwavering sense of change. -->
<!-- - `1:03:20`: actually different infection can harm the infection but what solutions have just the average one. -->
<!-- - `1:03:31`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `1:03:36`: yeah so you have some. -->
- `1:03:39`: **here we have some calculrations**.
- `1:03:42`: **which i actually want to skip because they for the exercices next week**.
<!-- - `1:03:54`: yeah what's happening in practice is a difference of instructions poverty is beautiful but basically you do weighted average pitches before every class the better frequency. -->
<!-- - `1:04:09`: and here we have some calculation again rehoming. -->
<!-- - `1:04:14`: he has. -->
<!-- - `1:04:16`: three pythagoreans about instruction. -->
<!-- - `1:04:19`: wish they would try to defend the guy then ring consequences depending on where in virginia we have then we can go and see them actually our. -->
- **then we could do a comparison and see that the second program is stacking one clock cycle less, however it has a average cpi which is lower**
<!-- - `1:04:31`: sick bro ruin the program. -->
<!-- - `1:04:35`: i was just thinking one looks like a mess. -->
<!-- - `1:04:41`: however the average city irish and no one. -->
<!-- - `1:04:48`: the visa could have another subject which will go on. -->
- `1:04:54`: so basically **when you start to have that you have to be careful in counting the number of instructions because if you count the number of instruction**. **we have here five instruction and here we have six instruction but somehow...** this five instruction.
# ==============1:05:00==============
<!-- - `1:05:12`: five instructional mothballs and six instructions that's because it's an instruction was for the losses. -->
<!-- - `1:05:24`: yes. -->
<!-- - `1:05:26`: so here you have this simple tradition again in a slightly more complicated funny instead he moved the ball well removing version. -->
<!-- - `1:05:36`: and the question is how do we hook up bones. -->
- `1:05:41`: so changing the **algorithm...** usually winter **affect the instruction count** because if **you have a foster program you will require fewer instructions** so the **most extreme example...** i can give is you try for fortune to saddam era would **generate a permutation until its sorted**.
- `1:06:00`: is probably or this is a very bad way of floating it's huge and i mean it terminates if it generates a new reputation each time but it's a very biodiverse.
- `1:06:12`: and so **switching to mergesort would reduce your instruction count a lot**.
- `1:06:16`: i read the reviews your buttonhole what.
- `1:06:22`: this **might have an impact on the cycles per instruction because we might be able to use different kinds of instructions**.
<!-- - `1:06:32`: not again. -->
<!-- - `1:06:34`: i'd originally wanted maybe he went through like one. -->
<!-- - `1:06:38`: but she was very outspoken. -->
<!-- - `1:06:41`: the program in different programming languages is usually without instruction cards and the instructions. -->
<!-- - `1:06:49`: pickup yard. -->
<!-- - `1:06:51`: because the you might be able to. -->
- `1:06:56`: it's hard to say how basically you **might be able to do things in one programming language that they cannot do in others** which means that you're going to get across the program.
<!-- - `1:07:05`: this program is actually i. -->
- `1:07:09`: the **compiler optimizes a lot and changes a lot of instructions**.
- `1:07:18`: and then at the lowest the **compiler is compiling a programming language to a instruction set architecture** protection the chimney.
<!-- - `1:07:29`: huge impact. -->
<!-- - `1:07:33`: no. -->
<!-- - `1:07:38`: if we try to look. -->
<!-- - `1:07:41`: interesting things is. -->
- `1:07:43`: i mean if you look at the **clock rate** over last year's anything needs and somehow it's cause i mean the change that **hasn't changed much over the last years**.
<!-- - `1:07:57`: i mean i think the reasons that i think. -->
<!-- - `1:08:06`: you. -->
<!-- - `1:08:10`: hm. -->
<!-- - `1:08:15`: the new regime. -->
<!-- - `1:08:18`: arguing. -->
<!-- - `1:08:25`: cycle of new evidence one anyway so basically if you look at very reasonable peed we have also a thing into a nonsense person to you which would which would lead you by the second. -->
<!-- - `1:08:40`: oh. -->
<!-- - `1:08:41`: basically that was again from greece. -->
- `1:08:44`: **the problem is basically why it stopped increasing** in **the amount of power we withdraw? has increased**.
<!-- - `1:08:54`: and basically yeah. -->
- `1:08:56`: **the faster your clock is the more power you need**.
- `1:09:01`: **the more power you have the more heat you produce** and it's important to remember that in terms of basic to use cpu has production of phones and instead of a smaller the production of heat which is extremely high it's much closer to the atomic reactor than this.
<!-- - `1:09:21`: one or something that's producing or local. -->
<!-- - `1:09:26`: now if we run a modern jumps on the power as we have a goal it would mean the power equal to the square of work at the. -->
- `1:09:40`: which means that **if you compare the last years we have actually reduced the voltage from 5V to 1V...** plan for the wonderful wonderful without increasing the maintenance the thousands.
- `1:09:53`: **which means we have increased our power by 200**
<!-- - `1:09:59`: ans. -->
# ==============1:10:00==============
- `1:10:02`: yeah i mean basically if you don't manage i mean **reducing the voltage more is extremely complicated...**.
- `1:10:09`: possibly because if you reduce the voltage to even this basic need to have one on the database because no one has any we all do this thing was.
- `1:10:21`: i mean **we all think of computers as the binary one zero and one but in practice we have intermediate things** which are kind of renewable others and then if you're mean.
<!-- - `1:10:35`: yeah this awesome ghost signals and basically if you want to make sure that we don't. -->
- `1:10:42`: the you want **to be sure that we don't confuse a ghost signal with a real signal** the portage for it which is basically the difference.
<!-- - `1:10:57`: now if you look at this again you can see that the number doesn't coun. -->
<!-- - `1:11:03`: and basically what happened is alex as the police because you have actually improve the capacity. -->
<!-- - `1:11:11`: how safe is boy but it was mostly hochman is that the wrong time keeper realize that the prayers we are making will not escape anymore for basically they have to find a better way to do it and basically what people mean is is that the instructions were to call the call. -->
<!-- - `1:11:31`: the door for you and your house and then he would walk or holiday spirits. -->
<!-- - `1:11:41`: and the point desert extra two or more causes can be similar in certain order which mean that basically you can do i mean you don't make things faster but you hope for the children to attend medical juveniles than. -->
<!-- - `1:11:59`: and so your power basically increases again. -->
<!-- - `1:12:04`: one reason the reason is basically that is more cause with nemo pocketing the travels of the pirates. -->
<!-- - `1:12:12`: and actually it's so bad now that there is a tempo dark cynical which the fact that we cannot use of new investments in every part of the. -->
<!-- - `1:12:26`: but sometimes torn between what you wanted news. -->
<!-- - `1:12:33`: now let's just as okay so here's a formula one resistant empowered. -->
<!-- - `1:12:38`: i suppose the cpu will have eighty five percent of capacity the queue but we haven't ruled that out by the manufacturing we have reduced the botnet lots anderson. -->
<!-- - `1:12:55`: and neat. -->
<!-- - `1:12:58`: opportunity. -->
<!-- - `1:13:00`: the breakfast thing and we compared to ours when we actually needed a slight reduction abort the pregnancy or the two holidays. -->
<!-- - `1:13:17`: yep and the issue is we can i mean it's called a power we cannot reduce voltage further and we cannot remove morton's. -->
<!-- - `1:13:27`: yeah so basically that and the fact that you cannot remove more heat is that's physics at some point. -->
<!-- - `1:13:34`: well the question is how can we improve performance further. -->
<!-- - `1:13:42`: well this is yeah but because the processes of the blues over last the pokemon. -->
<!-- - `1:13:49`: two years or something. -->
<!-- - `1:13:52`: but basically between the brisk process and the second most is the type of person. -->
<!-- - `1:13:59`: which is about right this basically means that just finding a new cpu residual performance and the packers twenty five percent. -->
<!-- - `1:14:07`: then they hide the end of the golden era golden era of the fifty percent jr which means that if your program is small just wait two or three more years and then the performance increases. -->
<!-- - `1:14:23`: yeah that basic he stopped around the tree which is the drop was. -->
<!-- - `1:14:30`: where it started to slow down was where the bones in queens was when the girl was just perfect i mean we'd go back and now he doesn't even vote on more. -->
<!-- - `1:14:43`: so we don't really managed to make buses to cuba anymore. -->
<!-- - `1:14:48`: i. -->
<!-- - `1:14:50`: so big is this murderous performance of the compete cpu so it takes into account everything but when you might wonder okay actually we see performance increases while the cpu is going to become foster and one of the reasons is that we have rid of several reasons. -->
# ==============1:15:00==============
<!-- - `1:15:10`: one of them is actually that our memory has become better but if you're have we actually because we have managed to produce smaller subdues but in practice we have made our cpu swarm we just have put more things in it and because we could put more things we could put more memory and this is options pocket extending. -->
<!-- - `1:15:30`: the last years because we have this memory which works better for which actually increase performance of programs. -->
<!-- - `1:15:42`: yup. -->
<!-- - `1:15:44`: i mean in the recent years threatened by the power the instruction level apartment and memory. -->
<!-- - `1:15:51`: oh never really mean that you have to wait for the murder i mean just imagine that you have something that doesn't you have to put on the hot and all the smoke it's time to give information and if you can avoid the probation then you actually the. -->
<!-- - `1:16:11`: molds and instructional practices and insights. -->
<!-- - `1:16:18`: in the repair i said actually we have started reading the koran says is true but actually we started off the cheating. -->
<!-- - `1:16:27`: they need that. -->
<!-- - `1:16:32`: but basically you look at the thing you can predict the next states but sometimes we. -->
<!-- - `1:16:38`: penetrating the next phase i mean the next state of events doesn't depend on what you could actually she's kind of cheated. -->
<!-- - `1:16:50`: and. -->
<!-- - `1:16:53`: two next the city. -->
<!-- - `1:17:03`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `1:17:09`: and basically that we managed to get more instructions although it was operating a program making use of being foster interest managed to think of something. -->
<!-- - `1:17:23`: then. -->
<!-- - `1:17:25`: this instruction is included in the especially the part where tactical choosing cuts the same time. -->
<!-- - `1:17:35`: i. -->
<!-- - `1:17:39`: one of. -->
<!-- - `1:17:41`: in very recent years. -->
<!-- - `1:17:45`: there's one thing i mentioned you saw you saw the weak persons border and basically for a long time the cpd was were basically two dimensional. -->
<!-- - `1:17:55`: right so basically incidents in recent years i started to make sense three dimensional so there isn't three the tragic origin which can headed for cash because you're basically because it's media can put more cash for product and it's closer to the cpu because again they ship with more cash but it's bigger. -->
<!-- - `1:18:15`: far away it takes a lot of fun so if you make it three d you can get more paul i mean you can get want more information trolls. -->
<!-- - `1:18:26`: so basically it is that the kid just waiting for your computer to get foster it yeah it's not super seriously i mean it can make your computer possible that's limited so what can we do to actually makes a computer faster. -->
<!-- - `1:18:42`: whether we can resist vertical microbial system but basically we have more than one of or something. -->
<!-- - `1:18:50`: which basically means the houses here divergence right to end up as in you've got eight calls with your order goes into executing to the same time. -->
<!-- - `1:19:05`: now when you use similar processors. -->
<!-- - `1:19:09`: and basically you need to break a groove around with the idea of the fallen. -->
<!-- - `1:19:16`: this is not in any way basically all the of years comic book really it's just cooperate separate out the hardware but from a programming point of view as for free. -->
<!-- - `1:19:28`: it's just thought two years warranty corp it's not for three anyone. -->
<!-- - `1:19:38`: yeah and it's something which is hard to do and then you have to program the fall on the lot financing so just imagine two sea views and one has finished and is what is just waiting for the other which is not what you wanted to write you want to use supposed to be used as much as possible which also means i have to optimize. -->
<!-- - `1:19:57`: mutation synchronization because when you want cpu to be to be able to tell the other hey i'm waiting give me working. -->
# ==============1:20:00==============
<!-- - `1:20:06`: and this also requires that we actually can kids which isn't always the case at some point you're combining rare i mean you're combining inflammation and burglary cannot. -->
<!-- - `1:20:16`: he dies in one. -->
<!-- - `1:20:19`: to take this into account. -->
<!-- - `1:20:26`: the is i'm not sick of benchmarks. -->
<!-- - `1:20:29`: which was defined in the pics. -->
<!-- - `1:20:35`: rockefeller from texas which is called strike. -->
<!-- - `1:20:38`: the product is used the better performance and it's also typical of oxford world. -->
<!-- - `1:20:46`: that's something i continue to discuss. -->
<!-- - `1:20:49`: that's something that can be discussed so basically we have some of the basic its core state boasted about performance immigration call and contains several kinds of vegetable. -->
<!-- - `1:21:04`: not in the coupons expire on the last time it's book that most people reserve the privilege about the input output. -->
<!-- - `1:21:15`: and it's normalized relative to a reference machine. -->
<!-- - `1:21:20`: and it's using geometric means of performance. -->
<!-- - `1:21:26`: just explain why the name. -->
<!-- - `1:21:37`: for basically humor apparently rachel suggested that. -->
<!-- - `1:21:42`: and another. -->
<!-- - `1:21:43`: the veterans are. -->
<!-- - `1:21:46`: what's new is basically the time all the random ones and the i phone. -->
<!-- - `1:21:58`: roads and square and who were on the ice basically. -->
<!-- - `1:22:08`: which means that when you compare the one who compared to the machine and the whole time provided by retros the sparingly. -->
<!-- - `1:22:23`: the marketing money buy the veterans actually my name is the artist and all. -->
<!-- - `1:22:32`: which means that you're compare machines independently of others. -->
<!-- - `1:22:37`: if you would. -->
<!-- - `1:22:39`: the game would have. -->
<!-- - `1:22:42`: he at any moment. -->
<!-- - `1:22:45`: but it was. -->
<!-- - `1:22:51`: and he would. -->
<!-- - `1:22:58`: if you you're under eighteen. -->
<!-- - `1:23:05`: you are going to have something like that over ratios divided by tune and you can see here that the referenced payments were on the rise. -->
<!-- - `1:23:15`: he was a most likely. -->
<!-- - `1:23:21`: but she's not actually the comparison is still dependent on the revenue especially when the jurich geometric mean is actually not dependence. -->
<!-- - `1:23:34`: let's have a quick look. -->
<!-- - `1:23:37`: over the. -->
<!-- - `1:23:41`: yeah so basically we have two different programs we have here in different applications so we have a current converters on the recommendation for climbing. -->
<!-- - `1:23:53`: the mediocre printing. -->
<!-- - `1:23:56`: the reputation with which they work different instructions com. -->
<!-- - `1:24:06`: and some different secure instructions because programs are more optimized. -->
<!-- - `1:24:12`: actual lore. -->
<!-- - `1:24:16`: i mean you should go get something like one person in bottle. -->
<!-- - `1:24:22`: and basically you know hugs it's seven get times the restaurants the machine and then you get this decoration which would then compare between versions. -->
<!-- - `1:24:34`: so he ends up so here's this is an intel xeon e pi. -->
<!-- - `1:24:41`: the thing the seventeen and possess big racial war the basically compared to the recurrence time it's the coupon book and master. -->
<!-- - `1:24:58`: hmm. -->
# ==============1:25:00==============
<!-- - `1:25:03`: just chick but i wanted to find one to go. -->
<!-- - `1:25:08`: okay i can move on. -->
<!-- - `1:25:14`: one thing which is tricky. -->
<!-- - `1:25:20`: it starts when it goes back. -->
<!-- - `1:25:23`: the thought they have got the better the public on some of service or different workflows. -->
<!-- - `1:25:30`: well this gives you a performance in operations per seconds normalized operation per seconds and then you can compare it with the number of watts. -->
<!-- - `1:25:39`: which is how much energy and strong and then it basically kindergarten operation all the. -->
<!-- - `1:25:45`: your repetitive with applications. -->
<!-- - `1:25:51`: and in the case of the sea on the south. -->
<!-- - `1:25:54`: group of his home therapy. -->
<!-- - `1:25:58`: football then you get probation over the phone. -->
<!-- - `1:26:06`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `1:26:08`: the results are thousands. -->
<!-- - `1:26:12`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `1:26:21`: newborn yeah okay. -->
- `1:26:24`: so one thing we have to **be careful** is that what we hope is an option.
- `1:26:29`: you don't have to the **power benchmark** of basic need the **power consumption is not linear with the load** but basically a portal consumption.
<!-- - `1:26:39`: the console country two hundred and sixty was fifty percent go to one hundred and seventy six but thirty percent one of the more than seven percent. -->
<!-- - `1:26:51`: so basically comparing the. -->
<!-- - `1:26:55`: next i mean the. -->
- `1:26:57`: you have to be careful when interpreting published about the practice according to data removal it **mostly operates on 10 and 50 percent load and it's very rarely goes the full ?**.
<!-- - `1:27:15`: but **basically** because it has been suspected you might want to have his vision he wanted to **increase performance** the lungs and then those people that need smoke or do any that would basically try to mix the scriptural proportional to where you basically would reduce something. -->
<!-- - `1:27:32`: so if you don't need a cpu it consumes barely any power. -->
<!-- - `1:27:38`: now this is the last sign i want to show. -->
<!-- - `1:27:45`: this is not a snob. -->
- `1:27:47`: part of islam and it's a **question**.
- `1:27:50`: **how much can i make my program faster by using this multiple cores thing**.
<!-- - `1:27:55`: i misread the vehicles or the garden. -->
<!-- - `1:28:05`: yes but basically mahal. -->
<!-- - `1:28:10`: hm hm hm. -->
- `1:28:21`: so basically sorry if you look at the programs you basically repugnant he **always two parts in a program** know how to hawk which is kind of like pasta and apart from the boston.
  - **one part u can make faster**
  - **one part u can't make faster**
<!-- - `1:28:34`: so basically just imagine how a program where a new phone which takes important one hundred victims phones one hundred and the agency the doctor. -->
- **program with 100s and you can make 80s faster**
<!-- - `1:28:48`: the bakery replaced the opponent out and just the atp and evicted was made for fun and then we have this inclusion centre and we basically want to reduce i mean we want to know what the human factor is and for example if they want to reach twenty we want to make a program take on the twenty second. -->
- **if you want to the program to take only 20s this is not goiing to work**
<!-- - `1:29:08`: realize that this is no polaroid. -->
<!-- - `1:29:11`: physical smallest state is say the nfl the puma is about the cancer he was make a lot of things posture but that's not going to be positive and what you can do. -->
<!-- - `1:29:29`: and this is young. -->
<!-- - `1:29:31`: and this is for young. -->
<!-- - `1:29:37`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `1:29:40`: yes and i think that's all i have to say other any question. -->
<!-- - `1:29:47`: no then see you all next week on tuesday while. -->
# ==============1:30:00==============
<!-- - `1:30:05`: the. -->
