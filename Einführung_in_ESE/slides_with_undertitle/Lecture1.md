<!-- - `0:00:20`: more from this first lecture. -->
<!-- - `0:00:23`: an introduction to embedded systems. -->
<!-- - `0:00:27`: i guess many of you have registered i think this is one of the record high number of participants we have so these are the numbers from last night and i guess many of you will be here. -->

- ![img_7](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:01:10_7.png)
<!-- - `0:01:10`: it's a fully virtual today i may also not be performing to my very best and we are also lacking a little bit behind in the planning of the lecture because of the situation. -->
- ![img_8](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:01:20_8.png)
<!-- - `0:01:24`: so anyway let's get started with this with his lecture and i'm responsible for for this lecture my name is mark assembling i joined the university of fribourg half a year ago in april and i will be giving this lecture introduction for embedded systems and there are. -->
- ![img_9](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:01:30_9.png)
- ![img_10](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:01:40_10.png)
<!-- - `0:01:44`: our two main books this lecture is based on one is from pete on my middle embedded system design and the other one is from georgia but that's all about hard real time computing systems. -->
- ![img_11](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:01:50_11.png)
<!-- - `0:01:59`: i would. -->
- ![img_12](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:02:00_12.png)
<!-- - `0:02:03`: then we admit a few more people. -->
<!-- - `0:02:06`: yup. -->
<!-- - `0:02:08`: you don't need to buy all these books but if you are interested in reading a bit more and understanding a bit more of the details and also a few more exercises. -->
- ![img_13](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:02:10_13.png)
- ![img_14](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:02:20_14.png)
<!-- - `0:02:20`: you are invited to to have a look at these books i'm sure that there are also online versions available for free is or pdfs of these books. -->
- ![img_15](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:02:30_15.png)
<!-- - `0:02:31`: so the the slight sir are based on yeah many people's inputs in materials and ideas on and of course preparing them myself in the end but so this is justin thanks to to all these people from around the world and that i'm boring. -->
- ![img_16](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:02:40_16.png)
- ![img_17](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:02:50_17.png)
<!-- - `0:02:51`: from. -->
<!-- - `0:02:53`: and so why are you here what what what will you learn you will learn about reworded and embedded systems. -->
- ![img_18](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:03:00_18.png)
<!-- - `0:03:02`: embedded system applications and what are the unique requirements and problems in these applications. -->
- ![img_19](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:03:10_19.png)
<!-- - `0:03:10`: and then based on these problems and different requirements some of which we will also discuss today already in the in the first lecture you will learn the basic concepts to analyze and design embedded systems that meet those requirements and solve these problems. -->
- ![img_20](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:03:20_20.png)
- ![img_21](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:03:30_21.png)
<!-- - `0:03:30`: and there will be two components in this course so there will be lectures of course where i will provide some theories and concepts explain them to you and on principles and practical aspects of embedded systems and there will be paper pencil exercises for you. -->
- ![img_22](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:03:40_22.png)
<!-- - `0:03:49`: to understand these concepts from the lecture a bit better. -->
- ![img_23](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:03:50_23.png)
<!-- - `0:03:56`: and the kind of exercise task you will be asked to solve are also quite similar to what you would see in the in the final exam so there will be elections and exercise. -->
- ![img_24](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:04:00_24.png)
<!-- - `0:04:08`: lectures will be given by me on tuesday in this time slot. -->
- ![img_25](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:04:10_25.png)
<!-- - `0:04:14`: i'm from eight to ten. -->
<!-- - `0:04:18`: the idea is to do everything in presence in the h as cera zero zero three six one thousand six hundred isis. -->
- ![img_26](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:04:20_26.png)
<!-- - `0:04:29`: in building one on one all elections will be given in english because we have many international participants it's quite a mixture of people in this course with different backgrounds so we will do this run for sure in english there will be live streaming available for one for sure because due to the suggest situation i would ex. -->
- ![img_27](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:04:30_27.png)
- ![img_28](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:04:40_28.png)

- ![img_29](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:04:50_29.png)
<!-- - `0:04:53`: to each lecture and there will also be recordings of the lectures. -->
<!-- - `0:04:58`: the exercises that we teaching assistants young matters and pascal vita and the exercises will take place also on tuesday up from twelve to two. -->
# ==============0:05:00==============
- ![img_30](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:00_30.png)
- ![img_31](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:00_31.png)
<!-- - `0:05:09`: and we will offer the exercises in english and in german so they are two separate groups that run in parallel for the entire duration. -->
- ![img_32](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:10_32.png)
- ![img_33](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:20_33.png)
<!-- - `0:05:22`: and you can choose and you can also switch so there's no a fixed fixed assignment we will try to make sure that there's space for everybody involved the english and the german exercise and again both exercises will also be livestreamed. -->
- ![img_34](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:30_34.png)
<!-- - `0:05:36`: the idea is here to use big blue button and and also everything will be recorded and made available after the excesses. -->
- ![img_35](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:40_35.png)
<!-- - `0:05:46`: so i've checked last nights. -->
- ![img_36](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:05:50_36.png)
<!-- - `0:05:50`: some of you already joined the course on alias please make sure sure to do so there's also a website for this course but this website is just. -->
- ![img_37](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:06:00_37.png)
<!-- - `0:06:01`: yeah provides just some general information on on the lecture and the main playground with all the resources and material for this lecture liddy on ilias so please scan this qr codes to get through the years cause or go to them. -->

- ![img_49](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:08:00_49.png)
<!-- - `0:08:04`: as i already said slides and recordings of the lecture will be provided after each lecture because i'm running this course for the very first time in cyborg and i'm making changes to the slides until they're very shortly before each lecture i will not be able to upload the slides before but after the lecture. -->
- ![img_50](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:08:10_50.png)
- ![img_51](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:08:20_51.png)
<!-- - `0:08:24`: including the recording the exercise sheets will be made available before the exercise as well as the slides from the exercise sessions a recording and also the solutions to the exercises. -->
- ![img_52](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:08:30_52.png)
<!-- - `0:08:38`: so that's a good moment to talk a little bit about the exercises i dunno if any of you will have attended the previous editions of this lecture this time the exercises are run in a in a different mode which we hope will help you so festival before the exercises make sure to download. -->
- ![img_53](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:08:40_53.png)
- ![img_54](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:08:50_54.png)
<!-- - `0:08:58`: tasks via the exercise sheet from from aliens and briefly have a look at the corresponding lecture material and also bring paper and pencil then you come to the exercise on tuesday twelfth and we will use the year one and a half hours or whatever that we have. -->
- ![img_55](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:09:00_55.png)
- ![img_56](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:09:10_56.png)
<!-- - `0:09:18`: available and in the beginning the teaching assistant will briefly summarise the lecture material for you that is important to solve all these questions and would also provide a few hints all you will have a good start and then you will be given some time to solve the questions yourself. -->
- ![img_57](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:09:20_57.png)
- ![img_58](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:09:30_58.png)
<!-- - `0:09:37`: so please come to the exercise and uses opportunity to try to solve the exercise questions yourself which will be very similar to what you will see in the exam. -->
- ![img_59](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:09:40_59.png)
<!-- - `0:09:48`: you will also be able to ask questions and i mean there might be many students many questions we will try our best while the teaching assistance will try their best to answer your questions and afterwards so after each journey let's say twenty minutes where you have for task one then for the task tour twenty minutes and after each. -->
# ==============0:10:00==============

- ![img_63](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:10:10_63.png)
<!-- - `0:10:15`: after the exercises the solutions will also be published on ilias and if you have any further questions go to the forum and if your friends or the teaching assistants don't ask directly on on the forum as a very last resort write an email to the. -->
- ![img_64](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:10:20_64.png)
- ![img_65](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:10:30_65.png)
<!-- - `0:10:34`: teaching assistant song yet an email addresses you may try to reach out to me but please expect long delays and yet i may not be able to answer. -->
- ![img_66](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:10:40_66.png)
<!-- - `0:10:46`: on the immense i'm i'm getting. -->
- ![img_67](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:10:50_67.png)
<!-- - `0:10:50`: so very importantly saudia the concrete schedule is still still in the making as i said in in in the beginning we had a few days off due to the virus and soul it's still a little bit in the making but today we will have the lecture but no exercise so you are free in the afternoon. -->
- ![img_68](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:11:00_68.png)
- ![img_69](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:11:10_69.png)
<!-- - `0:11:10`: around lunchtime next week there will definitely be a lecture and maybe also an exercise that still to be decided and also depending on on how fast we are to dave in this first lecture. -->
- ![img_70](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:11:20_70.png)
<!-- - `0:11:21`: in two weeks said as a holiday all saints' days or no election or exercises and afterwards i guess we will continue in a regular fashion with lecture in the morning on tuesdays and exercise after lunch. -->
- ![img_71](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:11:30_71.png)
<!-- - `0:11:34`: so please make sure to check ilias for updates it may also be you the movie might be the neat again to switch to fully virtual. -->
- ![img_72](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:11:40_72.png)
<!-- - `0:11:44`: and also if if there's really nobody of your coming through the lectures any more i may also decide to move fully fully virtually just because this may awesome based on experience hybrid really hybrid teaching is very very challenging and not a very good experience for everybody so. -->
- ![img_73](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:11:50_73.png)
- ![img_74](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:12:00_74.png)
<!-- - `0:12:02`: yeah so if if there's a re on you and a handful of people in the lecture hall we may decide to switch to fully virtual as well. -->
- ![img_75](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:12:10_75.png)
<!-- - `0:12:12`: but i hope that this will not happen and yes saw in the first lecture we are usually not supposed to talk about the exam but yeah so there will be a final exam after the the lecturing period. -->
- ![img_76](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:12:20_76.png)
<!-- - `0:12:27`: i. -->
<!-- - `0:12:29`: few more people are joining. -->
- ![img_77](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:12:30_77.png)
<!-- - `0:12:32`: it will be a written exam two hours and the questions in the exercise will be given in both english and german so don't be afraid y'all will be able to understand everything we will make sure that the translations are correct and the date and the place will be announced. -->
- ![img_78](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:12:40_78.png)
- ![img_79](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:12:50_79.png)
<!-- - `0:12:51`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `0:12:53`: but it will be within this timeframe between middle of february when lectures end and the end of the semester and we will try will make sure i guess too. -->
- ![img_80](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:13:00_80.png)
<!-- - `0:13:06`: give you the chance to solve an example exam or at least example exam questions and discuss them in the last exercise session. -->
- ![img_81](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:13:10_81.png)
<!-- - `0:13:14`: so hopefully this gives you awesome goods and no preparation for fun. -->
- ![img_82](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:13:20_82.png)
<!-- - `0:13:23`: okay so this is about organizational stuff and are there any questions on the organization. -->
- ![img_83](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:13:30_83.png)
<!-- - `0:13:37`: so are there any questions i can find the earliest course and maybe one of you can post the link or i think you will you will figure it out okay thanks thanks a lot and exercises are not not graded i know but as i said the exercises as oppose. -->
- ![img_84](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:13:40_84.png)
- ![img_85](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:13:50_85.png)
<!-- - `0:13:56`: used to really help you understand the lecture material and also it's a very good preparation for the exam. -->
- ![img_86](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:14:00_86.png)
<!-- - `0:14:02`: i. -->
<!-- - `0:14:07`: okay. -->
- ![img_87](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:14:10_87.png)
<!-- - `0:14:12`: so now now is there the time where. -->
<!-- - `0:14:19`: i may be supposed to tell you that embedded systems is the most important and the most exciting field on the planet and it's the most important course that you would ever take and of course this is not the case there are many many other exciting courses. -->
- ![img_88](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:14:20_88.png)
- ![img_89](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:14:30_89.png)
<!-- - `0:14:34`: software engineering programming not to mention machine learning but certainly embedded systems do play and a very important role so i'm going to give you an hour and introduction to what embedded systems are and what they their unique properties and afterwards i will give an overview of what you will learn. -->
- ![img_90](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:14:40_90.png)
- ![img_91](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:14:50_91.png)
<!-- - `0:14:54`: intellectual so this is maybe one way to define embedded systems it's an it's an information processing system the computing system that is embedded into a larger product and this embedding into a larger product is actually an important property of embedded system. -->
# ==============0:15:00==============
- ![img_92](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:00_92.png)
- ![img_93](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:00_93.png)
- ![img_94](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:10_94.png)
<!-- - `0:15:14`: saw one do i mean with the saw maybe one very good example is you are not going to buy a washing machine to do computing right and you're maybe also not buying a smartphone to do computing you're buying a washing machine to wash your clothes and are buying a smartphone tool yeah socialized to connect with the other people. -->
- ![img_95](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:20_95.png)
- ![img_96](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:30_96.png)
<!-- - `0:15:36`: yes am i you showing some slides we are seeing those lights you seeing on lights yes. -->
- ![img_97](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:40_97.png)
<!-- - `0:15:46`: oh my god. -->
<!-- - `0:15:47`: it was at the beginning in detroit and we thought that perhaps you are talking and not showing enjoying dislikes later ah ok thanks a lot for this for this okay i completely forgot to share share my screen thanks hello. -->
- ![img_98](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:15:50_98.png)
- ![img_99](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:16:00_99.png)
<!-- - `0:16:03`: i. -->
<!-- - `0:16:07`: okay so all this lights will will be uploaded so you can have a look at the organizational part after after the detection. -->
- ![img_100](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:16:10_100.png)
<!-- - `0:16:16`: okay let me. -->
- ![img_101](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:16:20_101.png)
<!-- - `0:16:20`: okay here we go excuse me. -->
<!-- - `0:16:27`: this virus is. -->
- ![img_102](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:16:30_102.png)
<!-- - `0:16:30`: wow. -->
<!-- - `0:16:31`: i dunno what it was. -->
<!-- - `0:16:34`: okay so let's rewind so this may be so here i started to talk about embedded systems and that these embedded systems are information processing systems that are embedded into a larger product a smart horse i mentioned and washing machine that is not here but also robot or. -->
- ![img_103](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:16:40_103.png)
- ![img_104](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:16:50_104.png)
<!-- - `0:16:54`: a medical device or a drone so these are all examples of systems where you have some computing inside but the main purpose of the systems such as a smart house or a washing machine is not to do computing of course you can do computing in the smart house there are and reasonably many processes in the house these days. -->
- ![img_105](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:17:00_105.png)
- ![img_106](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:17:10_106.png)
<!-- - `0:17:14`: i am but it's not the main purpose. -->
<!-- - `0:17:19`: and the. -->
- ![img_107](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:17:20_107.png)
<!-- - `0:17:21`: the. -->
<!-- - `0:17:22`: the idea is is that yeah dependent by interacting with the with the environment so that you use these embedded system such as a smart horse race you have embedded computing units in a small house you have sensors for example you can understand certain properties about the environment for example who is making a phone. -->
- ![img_108](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:17:30_108.png)
- ![img_109](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:17:40_109.png)
<!-- - `0:17:42`: call on who is entering your street when may have cameras so all kinds of sensors. -->
- ![img_110](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:17:50_110.png)
<!-- - `0:17:53`: all kinds of pressure sensors humidity and temperature sensors on your smartphone as well it can detect how fast you're walking and can detect what kind of activity you are doing so you're basically learning you can you can get all these data and learn about the environment so this is what this the slightest is supposed to to surely. -->
- ![img_111](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:18:00_111.png)
- ![img_112](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:18:10_112.png)
<!-- - `0:18:11`: and. -->
<!-- - `0:18:18`: so there was another question on the chant. -->
- ![img_113](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:18:20_113.png)
<!-- - `0:18:21`: let's get back to the isn't it. -->
<!-- - `0:18:24`: and. -->
<!-- - `0:18:29`: yes so and there are many many different names for for this for this. -->
- ![img_114](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:18:30_114.png)
<!-- - `0:18:36`: area of embedded systems are for embedded systems one of them was called the same physical system or you may have also heard the term internet of things. -->
- ![img_115](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:18:40_115.png)
<!-- - `0:18:46`: they're even in this refer to zero. -->
- ![img_116](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:18:50_116.png)
<!-- - `0:18:50`: the farc machine to machine communication or internet of everything or smarter planet so these are terms that come from different institutions and i think there's a smarter plan that comes from bush the industry four zero is very popular in germany and means that then you have basically embedded systems. -->
- ![img_117](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:19:00_117.png)
- ![img_118](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:19:10_118.png)

<!-- - `0:25:50`: but they are embedded or interconnected with the physical world. -->
<!-- - `0:25:56`: and okay so so what's the point the point is now that. -->
- ![img_161](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:26:00_161.png)
<!-- - `0:26:02`: if you are embedded and interacting with the environment you need to do this you may need to do this array often have to do this in a continuous fashion. -->
- ![img_162](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:26:10_162.png)
<!-- - `0:26:12`: so your receives stimuli or central inputs or certain events from the environment in the embedded system needs to continuously measure these these inputs and react to them and this is what what is called a reactive system. -->
- ![img_163](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:26:20_163.png)
<!-- - `0:26:27`: this one which is in continual interaction with its environment and executes at a pace that is determined by the environment. -->
- ![img_164](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:26:30_164.png)
<!-- - `0:26:35`: so depending on how fast your physical processes like this pendulum or you have a car or a washing machine though these are completely different physical processes that execute or evolve with different speeds. -->
- ![img_165](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:26:40_165.png)
- ![img_166](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:26:50_166.png)
<!-- - `0:26:51`: so certainly if you'll want to control the temperature in the room. -->
<!-- - `0:26:57`: the pace is much much slower than what the embedded system needs to provide in a in an autonomous car that's clear right. -->
- ![img_167](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:27:00_167.png)
<!-- - `0:27:06`: sawyer have to continuously interact end. -->
- ![img_168](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:27:10_168.png)
<!-- - `0:27:10`: the second very important requirement of embedded system many embedded systems is that you have to interact with the environment in real time. -->
- ![img_169](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:27:20_169.png)
<!-- - `0:27:20`: so you have to guarantee that you will not only compute the correct result. -->
<!-- - `0:27:27`: for example the controller signal you have and either rural and the this either of them should not only compute the correct result let's say ten but it also needs to provide this resides ten. -->

<!-- - `0:27:41`: within a certain deadline. -->
<!-- - `0:27:44`: so yup. -->
<!-- - `0:27:48`: because if it computes the correct result but it provides the result too late then this is considered incorrect. -->
- ![img_172](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:27:50_172.png)
<!-- - `0:27:57`: even though the the number itself is correct but because it comes too late it's considered incorrect. -->
- ![img_173](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:28:00_173.png)
<!-- - `0:28:05`: and there are soft and hard real-time systems are hard real-time systems are one where if you really provide the the answer too late this may have catastrophic comforting or consequences such as humans are being killed or harmed right so if you have various safety critical embedded system enough. -->

<!-- - `0:29:21`: okay so this light discusses two very important properties of embedded systems and. -->
- ![img_182](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:29:30_182.png)
<!-- - `0:29:30`: the first one says it is essential to predict how a cyber physical or embedded system is going to behave under any circumstances before it is deployed. -->
- ![img_183](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:29:40_183.png)
<!-- - `0:29:41`: and that's that again relates to the mission or safety critical nature of many of the system so if you operate an autonomous car you'll want to or essentially have a formal proof a mathematical proof that the system will behave correctly once i'm putting it into operation so once i'm so. -->
# ==============0:30:00==============

- ![img_187](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:30:10_187.png)
<!-- - `0:30:10`: so it very clearly and this means that he will lead we have to have models that allow us to predict how this the entire system is going to behave and that is of course very very complex. -->
- ![img_188](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:30:20_188.png)
<!-- - `0:30:24`: the second statement says imbalances or cyber-physical must operate independently. -->
- ![img_189](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:30:30_189.png)
<!-- - `0:30:30`: and here it basically means that it needs to provide the correct function. -->
<!-- - `0:30:38`: should also operate safely so that's that's the next step statement here safely safely basically means that okay you don't hung anyone or awesome operate securely and if you have an embedded system that is dependable safe and secure then very likely people. -->
- ![img_190](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:30:40_190.png)
- ![img_191](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:30:50_191.png)
<!-- - `0:30:57`: who will trust the system right so these three adjectives are are needed to provide trust together also with the predictions so if you have a form proof everything is going to behave correctly and in under any circumstances it will be secure and nobody will be harmed then you'll trust and also use assist so this is what we. -->

<!-- - `0:31:18`: system very often also needs needs to operate efficiently and there will be a slight about this very soon and in real time and we discuss real-time already on an appearance. -->

- ![img_195](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:31:30_195.png)
<!-- - `0:31:30`: okay. -->
<!-- - `0:31:33`: yeah so. -->
<!-- - `0:31:35`: again is a concierge should allow you to relate these these terms here and the need for a reliable safe secure and real-time operation tool critical domains autonomous cars and war absence. -->

<!-- - `0:32:02`: and your may have a smartphone or you also have sensors on many many devices maybe millions of internet of things devices that don't have a power block so you don't have a cable that goes to your to your power socket you have a battery so these devices are running on an. -->

- ![img_201](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:32:30_201.png)
<!-- - `0:32:32`: so if you do some calculations and you have let's say a billions of batteries on the earth and each of these these batteries last only for three years you're going to replace hundreds of millions of batteries every day and this is of course an infeasible infeasible effort. -->

- ![img_355](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:57:20_355.png)
<!-- - `0:57:21`: very very important task but for maintenance or for testing if you're if you want to get just some information about the current battery level for example this is not some critical and therefore you want to use a non real time task to implement this functionality. -->
- ![img_356](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:57:30_356.png)
<!-- - `0:57:39`: so yeah you. -->
- ![img_357](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:57:40_357.png)
<!-- - `0:57:42`: don't need to fully understand this slide here but the main point of the slightest to give you some idea about the complexity of such system so let me walk you through this and to give you some idea of the complexity saw these other sensors. -->
- ![img_358](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:57:50_358.png)
<!-- - `0:57:58`: the gyroscope for example and on the accelerometer so these other sensors that tell you something about the current state of the drum. -->
- ![img_359](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:58:00_359.png)
<!-- - `0:58:07`: and these are actually read out here as you conceive of a very very highest speed so you you're basically doing over something silly or something sticking with a killer hertz or one kilohertz in the case of the sutherland. -->
- ![img_360](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:58:10_360.png)
- ![img_361](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:58:20_361.png)
<!-- - `0:58:22`: and based on these many many samples there's already some local pre processing some local featuring the undone and every five hundred hertz we these samples the most recent sample or some moving average of the samples is being read out. -->
- ![img_362](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:58:30_362.png)
<!-- - `0:58:39`: again over a bus protocol is called ice current seat. -->
- ![img_363](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:58:40_363.png)
<!-- - `0:58:45`: and then you do some cleaning some processing and yeah you're doing the excess mapping and so on you're fusing all these are all the sensor signals and then you were doing this is taken as an input to the actual control ever been so the automatic control algorithm that needs to execute every minute. -->
- ![img_364](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:58:50_364.png)
- ![img_365](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:59:00_365.png)
<!-- - `0:59:05`: second or every ten milliseconds depending on what you want to do to compute a correct and timely real time. -->
- ![img_366](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:59:10_366.png)
<!-- - `0:59:14`: input tool to the mortar to the actuation so as you can see this is a pretty deep processing pipeline with a one two three four five six different stages and all of this needs to work in real time. -->
- ![img_367](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:59:20_367.png)
- ![img_368](./_Lecture1_imgs/0:59:30_368.png)
<!-- - `0:59:32`: everything needs to fit nicely together. -->
<!-- - `0:59:35`: you don't want to lose any samples along the way you don't want to overrun any deadlines here and there so this is a complex mixture of hyper components that are being used by software later on so the left side here is as hardware in here. -->

- ![img_373](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:00:10_373.png)
<!-- - `1:00:10`: insight or overview of what you will learn and in the lecture and i will do this by means of questions so let's have a look at the at the time i will do this in by means of questions and you don't have to be able to answer these questions right now but hopefully and you're actually supposed to be able to answer these questions at the end of the. -->
- ![img_374](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:00:20_374.png)
<!-- - `1:00:29`: entire lecture so in february when i give you these questions again you should be able to to answer some of these questions so you may not understand everything what i'm saying right now but it gives you some idea of what you will learn so one of the questions is what can you do to increase the performance of an embedded system rates on you may have a very. -->

- ![img_376](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:00:40_376.png)
- ![img_377](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:00:50_377.png)
<!-- - `1:00:50`: application you'll have an autonomous car and you need to do many many many controls much more than on this on this crazy flag so what can you do to increase performance and as you may have learned in other lectures or already guessed. -->
- ![img_378](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:01:00_378.png)
<!-- - `1:01:04`: one way is to use faster and more complex processes and this is moore's law so it is a trend that continues over time over time we see that the transistor count so the number of active hardware elements on these processes is. -->
- ![img_379](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:01:10_379.png)
- ![img_380](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:01:20_380.png)
<!-- - `1:01:24`: rapidly increasing exponentially increasing and yeah you can the sea on fire for example in twin ts seventeen i think it came out yeah and it has yeah more than i don't know exactly maybe twenty billion i think that should be twenty billion. -->
- ![img_381](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:01:30_381.png)
- ![img_382](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:01:40_382.png)
<!-- - `1:01:44`: transistors and this. -->
<!-- - `1:01:48`: this trend will continue and maybe not maybe it would have flattened out that yeah you have the basic ideas that you have you can use more complex and faster processes where each individual core has more and more active transistors but of course you can also and this is actually the trend that has started. -->
- ![img_383](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:01:50_383.png)
- ![img_384](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:02:00_384.png)
<!-- - `1:02:08`: some time ago now is to use multiple of these process in court now so not only one with many transistors you will go a parallel. -->
- ![img_385](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:02:10_385.png)
<!-- - `1:02:18`: and this is a picture of the iphone. -->

<!-- - `1:02:22`: i'm not exactly sure which model of the iphone but this is the process as h h ralph saw and it comes with six different course at least like general nah not really general purpose but yeah embedded computing horse and two high performance. -->
- ![img_387](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:02:30_387.png)
- ![img_388](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:02:40_388.png)
<!-- - `1:02:42`: course are here and four and. -->
<!-- - `1:02:45`: what other cores are. -->
<!-- - `1:02:49`: the big way or the because again it's a tool for for high performance dance and for lower performance task and this one here is a form and also tool to increase the performance you'll very often use very dedicated specialized processes. -->
- ![img_389](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:02:50_389.png)
- ![img_390](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:03:00_390.png)
<!-- - `1:03:08`: not only to increase performance but also to make the the overall system efficient which we will talk about in a minute so for example and very often nowadays we use machine learning models to do all kinds of things or even do some preprocessing on the smartphone not only in the cloud will be. -->
- ![img_391](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:03:10_391.png)
- ![img_392](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:03:20_392.png)
<!-- - `1:03:28`: train the models you can also do some training and inference of these neural networks on the devices itself and are dedicated to processing elements for these neural architectures for these neural network computation matrix computations. -->
- ![img_393](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:03:30_393.png)
- ![img_394](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:03:40_394.png)
<!-- - `1:03:45`: or graphics is also very good examples with cheap your course dedicated to graphics and of course very high performance caches to do very efficient data movement between these different elements. -->
- ![img_395](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:03:50_395.png)
<!-- - `1:03:58`: so the trend or for you to remember is that we are going faster more complex more parallel and this allows you to achieve higher performance. -->
- ![img_396](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:04:00_396.png)
- ![img_397](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:04:10_397.png)
<!-- - `1:04:12`: hmm. -->
<!-- - `1:04:17`: next question what can you do to decrease power consumption we talked about efficiency in the beginning what can you do to increase parkinson's. -->
- ![img_398](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:04:20_398.png)
<!-- - `1:04:26`: well what i just mentioned is that you can you can. -->
- ![img_399](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:04:30_399.png)
<!-- - `1:04:30`: design or include specialized circuits if you have tasks then you have to do very often your design and esic a chip that does justice this can increase both the performance but it can also bring down the energy consumption the power consumption because it's specifically designed for this purpose. -->
- ![img_400](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:04:40_400.png)
- ![img_401](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:04:50_401.png)
<!-- - `1:04:51`: and another aspect is that maybe a little bit surprising to some of you is that by using minds of course so executing things in parallel. -->
# ==============1:05:00==============
- ![img_402](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:00_402.png)
- ![img_403](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:00_403.png)
<!-- - `1:05:03`: one can actually decrease the energy consumption saw para realism or using multiple costs instead of one big core can decrease the overall energy consumption. -->
- ![img_404](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:10_404.png)
<!-- - `1:05:15`: and this is something that we can see yeah i mean it's already seven years old but you have this specialized chip for image processing signal processing scientific computing and what you can see here is year billions of one hundred fifty billions of operations per watt. -->
- ![img_405](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:20_405.png)
- ![img_406](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:30_406.png)
<!-- - `1:05:35`: so per what. -->
<!-- - `1:05:37`: and you can see that the dinamo of course was is going up. -->
- ![img_407](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:40_407.png)
<!-- - `1:05:42`: but the number of operations then you can do per watt so the overall efficiency is article i read so by by by doing i'm including more course you can and could compute execute more operations more efficiently. -->
- ![img_408](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:05:50_408.png)
<!-- - `1:05:58`: and he has actually a very high level block there from of this architecture so we have sixteen clusters in each of these clusters consists of sixteen course so it's this is an example picture of this middle configuration you have two hundred and fifty six course. -->
- ![img_409](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:06:00_409.png)
- ![img_410](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:06:10_410.png)
- ![img_411](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:06:20_411.png)
<!-- - `1:06:20`: yeah so there's just one one example and it might be a little bit surprising but you will learn in the lecture why parallelism can decrease energy consumption. -->
- ![img_412](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:06:30_412.png)
<!-- - `1:06:31`: yeah that's the question. -->
<!-- - `1:06:34`: and yeah so this is something that you will learn in intellectual. -->
- ![img_413](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:06:40_413.png)
<!-- - `1:06:40`: and this is another nice nice nice picture a half year from a rubber old samsung galaxy model. -->
- ![img_414](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:06:50_414.png)
<!-- - `1:06:50`: again here you can see that they were increased the capabilities the computer combat abilities but also made the system more efficient by using dedicated blocks for example for mighty meteor they have dedicated hardware blocks for mighty media also for the display and the comer. -->
- ![img_415](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:07:00_415.png)
- ![img_416](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:07:10_416.png)
<!-- - `1:07:11`: dedicated cause and parallelism so here are four course. -->
<!-- - `1:07:17`: in this cortex a fifteen and another four course here. -->
- ![img_417](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:07:20_417.png)
<!-- - `1:07:24`: vortex a civil quick. -->
<!-- - `1:07:26`: so. -->
<!-- - `1:07:28`: parallelism. -->
- ![img_418](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:07:30_418.png)
<!-- - `1:07:31`: increases the complexity which is bad because it makes the system harder to understand but it allows you to make the system more efficient and increase the capabilities. -->
- ![img_419](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:07:40_419.png)
<!-- - `1:07:43`: okay how to manage extreme workload variability and whether for example your you might be idling for example now writes your you will have a lecture you don't have much to do or during the night but then maybe after after this the sooner the lecturer you will call your friend or. -->
- ![img_420](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:07:50_420.png)
- ![img_421](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:08:00_421.png)
<!-- - `1:08:01`: you will take a bike so you have to be very active and you have to expend much more energy than you are probably doing so your workload or our workload over the day varies very low birk loved during the night and maybe during a lecture hopefully you are still awake and listening to me but sometimes when you are really under stress for example you're in. -->
- ![img_422](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:08:10_422.png)
- ![img_423](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:08:20_423.png)
<!-- - `1:08:21`: and and you have a very critical task such and such as an exam you will have to focus you'll have to execute. -->
- ![img_424](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:08:30_424.png)
<!-- - `1:08:32`: at your peak performance and you're also allowed and will use a lot of much more energy than in your and during faces where you have very little to do and this is what i mean with workload variability and this is very common and if your smartphone is just sitting around it does nothing but when you. -->
- ![img_425](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:08:40_425.png)
- ![img_426](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:08:50_426.png)
<!-- - `1:08:51`: inter interact with the smartphone it needs to wake up very very quickly and it needs to and maybe also start up different different components more powerful processors and to get the work done and this is exactly what what is being being done on many many embedded systems that you turn. -->
- ![img_427](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:09:00_427.png)
- ![img_428](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:09:10_428.png)
<!-- - `1:09:12`: entire cpu was for example like this this big cluster of more powerful cpu was is turned off when you have low lord but when you interact with the system and it actually has something important to do this big cluster of more powerful cpu is astronomer. -->

- ![img_430](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:09:30_430.png)
- `1:09:30`: and by doing this **duty cycling** is called duty savings switching components on and off.
<!-- - `1:09:37`: yeah your you can save power when you have a very low workload and during phases with a higher workload you can execute these tasks efficiently and you actually ought to increase the efficiency because you are handling these more heavy tasks with dedicated more powerful pro. -->

- ![img_436](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:10:20_436.png)
<!-- - `1:10:25`: i thought each admin assistant in isolation is not very useful i mean a smartphone is not very useful if it cannot communicate with other smartphones with with the base station for example a laptop needs to communicate and on your laptop or smartphone you also use cloud services so. -->

- ![img_440](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:11:00_440.png)
<!-- - `1:11:05`: and the trend is clear so we are able to design and build smaller more capable and better systems some of them are of the size of a grain of salt hardly visible and this is the vision of smartest isolate this vision has been around. -->

- ![img_448](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:12:20_448.png)
<!-- - `1:12:25`: and at the very end of this chain here you have these various small sensors and the smaller sensors. -->
- ![img_449](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:12:30_449.png)
<!-- - `1:12:34`: they are embedded into a bridge in your body for example as i already tried to explain they need to operate for a very very long time so very often what you will see nowadays is that these devices are getting their energy not from a primary battery but they actually harvesting energy from from an environment and yen. -->
- ![img_450](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:12:40_450.png)
- ![img_451](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:12:50_451.png)

- ![img_452](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:13:00_452.png)
<!-- - `1:13:03`: and in a later iteration they really made the small the size of the swords half of the size of a of the rice grain. -->
- ![img_453](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:13:10_453.png)
<!-- - `1:13:12`: and at the very top of this layered architecture the very top they have a solar cell using the solar so the system can extract some electrical energy that is stored in the battery so that's the second layer then there's some power management here. -->

<!-- - `1:13:38`: and some entering. -->
- ![img_456](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:13:40_456.png)
<!-- - `1:13:40`: and yeah there's the poor management which makes sure that energy from the solar cell is put into the battery and wedded when it is needed power actually flows through to the various hardware components that need. -->
- ![img_457](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:13:50_457.png)
<!-- - `1:13:54`: i need the power. -->
<!-- - `1:13:59`: yes and they made this much smaller and in a later iteration year there they were also able to attach various sensors a flash memory serial port for programming i would sketch and also bluetooth low energy radio so you can interact with this marry a very small device. -->

- ![img_462](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:14:40_462.png)
<!-- - `1:14:41`: i have to communicate with each other saw a single embedded device is not very useful if you want a bit more complex systems they need to interact with each other and very very often nowadays this happens over a wireless communication. -->

<!-- - `1:16:20`: as i already said you cannot go around and replace all of these batteries regularly they should operate for ten twenty thirty years and as long as the product is in use and some of the products that we use such as a wall or in a smart smart wall a smart device or a sam. -->

<!-- - `1:16:40`: i system that monitors the state of of the environments such as the health of of trees in the forest for example so if you if you plant the tree and you put on the sensor that regularly checks the health of the tree if it gets enough water if there is any any infection of the tree you want. -->

<!-- - `1:17:01`: that this sensor can essentially operate for as long as the tree is growing. -->
<!-- - `1:17:08`: after eighty hundred years when when we use the tree to build furniture for example we cut the tree and then the sensor is not no longer needed but if you think about the take the example of a of a tree central then the sensor should really be be put on the tree and. -->

- ![img_479](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:17:20_479.png)
<!-- - `1:17:27`: it should operate for fifty sixty seventy years until you cut the tree this is not something that is possible today but this is where the entire field and the technology is going and for this we need energy harvesting we need to extract energy from the environment solar temperature differences. -->

<!-- - `1:17:48`: as vibration so for example when humans are walking we can extract electrical energy from from the vibrations to operate some sensors that we have on our bodies. -->
- ![img_482](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:17:50_482.png)
<!-- - `1:17:59`: and very recently and we also doing some research in this area is that we want to get ripped off of off the batteries and use other other devices to store energy because batteries don't last very long you'll have a limited number of charging cycles for batteries and therefore for example capacitors are being used. -->

<!-- - `1:19:02`: there's a question yeah one question do you hear me yes i can hear you. -->
<!-- - `1:19:08`: ask about realtime i think actually you extreme. -->
<!-- - `1:19:13`: ask again if it's possible could you explain again the time he has as he stems it means like it's predicted and it should be give the answers and yeah. -->
- ![img_490](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:19:18_490.png)
<!-- - `1:19:27`: i'm incorrect at the time they clashed yes yes yes exactly so very often the term real-time is confused very often people think about real-time as doing things very quickly. -->
- ![img_491](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:19:30_491.png)
- ![img_492](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:19:40_492.png)
<!-- - `1:19:44`: but but as we will see in the lecture and there will be a couple of lectures about real time scheduling and where will you will we will define this very very concretely i am real time for us in this course means that we have to finish certain activities such as a computation within a certain tie. -->

<!-- - `1:20:04`: comment about let's say ten to ten milliseconds it doesn't matter if we finished the task earlier if he finishes it within three milliseconds or five we don't care we only care that you finish it within ten milliseconds and this ten milliseconds is what we call a real time constraint or real time deadline and if you have a task. -->

<!-- - `1:20:50`: we will go into much more detail in one of the late elections. -->
<!-- - `1:20:55`: well. -->
<!-- - `1:20:56`: just some one wanted to talk briefly about and software development and. -->
- ![img_501](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:21:00_501.png)
<!-- - `1:21:03`: for embedded systems and this is now the rubber short second chapter that i would like to start and finish today. -->
- ![img_502](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:21:10_502.png)
<!-- - `1:21:17`: so. -->
- ![img_503](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:21:20_503.png)
<!-- - `1:21:20`: i guess some of you who have attended lectures on computer architecture or programming you may be familiar with this but to just establish a common ground for all of you this graph shows all the process of getting from a. -->
- ![img_504](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:21:30_504.png)
<!-- - `1:21:39`: grimm that you have written like the hello world program for embedded systems that fleshes the lcd. -->
- ![img_505](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:21:40_505.png)
<!-- - `1:21:47`: into something that is actually executed on an embedded system. -->
- ![img_506](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:21:50_506.png)
<!-- - `1:21:52`: and usually in embedded systems we don't you we don't use python or java for various reasons and one of them is efficiency in embedded systems very often we use c programming language that is called c. -->
- ![img_507](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:22:00_507.png)
<!-- - `1:22:08`: and then the c program is still a pretty human readable and but it cannot be executed on on the actual hardware so we need to have a compiler a cooler tools is used compiler that translates your c program in that you have written. -->
- ![img_508](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:22:10_508.png)
- ![img_509](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:22:20_509.png)
<!-- - `1:22:28`: into an intermediate representation it's still fairly readable but it's a much much longer program and not so not so easy to understand. -->
- ![img_510](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:22:30_510.png)
- ![img_511](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:22:40_511.png)
<!-- - `1:22:40`: and then there's a another tool called an assembler it's unfortunate naming but it is called an assembler that takes this intermediate assembly program and translates it into a machine language module or something that is that is almost ready to be executed or it could. -->
- ![img_512](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:22:50_512.png)
- ![img_513](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:23:00_513.png)
<!-- - `1:23:00`: potentially be executed already on and on your architecture but as we have seen very often you'll want to use other software components or like an operating system that already provide some functionality for timers and. -->
- ![img_514](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:23:10_514.png)
- ![img_515](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:23:20_515.png)
<!-- - `1:23:20`: fox or reading all sensors there might be some software library that you can use to read out a temperature sensor you don't have to write this yourself and to weave or integrate your your program that you have written with this existing software component. -->
- ![img_516](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:23:30_516.png)
<!-- - `1:23:39`: you need what is called a linker that does this interconnection saw your statement read our temperature sensor that this is actually being met with something that is really executed this linker make sure that it caused the right functionality from an existing library. -->
- ![img_517](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:23:40_517.png)
- ![img_518](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:23:50_518.png)
<!-- - `1:23:59`: the linker outputs a machine language rogen which is it's it's a binary representation as well as here so these are just using once and once you put this onto your embedded system it can can be loaded from. -->
- ![img_519](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:24:00_519.png)
- ![img_520](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:24:10_520.png)
<!-- - `1:24:16`: from an ephraim ephraim and the executed. -->
- ![img_521](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:24:20_521.png)
<!-- - `1:24:20`: so this is the year the entire and compilation chain. -->
<!-- - `1:24:25`: and. -->
<!-- - `1:24:27`: what is quite special in embedded systems is that. -->
- ![img_522](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:24:30_522.png)
<!-- - `1:24:32`: so this is what we what we have just seen so we have the source code and the compiler and it's and it spits out something or output something that can be executed on the embedded system so what you can see here on the slide is that. -->
- ![img_523](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:24:40_523.png)
<!-- - `1:24:45`: the host so your own pc. -->
<!-- - `1:24:49`: where you have developed the program and compiled it is not the same hardware where it is executed so you'll develop it here on your host pc and it is being executed on a different hardware component. -->
# ==============1:25:00==============
- ![img_524](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:00_524.png)
- ![img_525](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:24:50_525.png)
- ![img_526](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:00_526.png)
<!-- - `1:25:05`: and bridging this gap here between your pc and here is not the trivia. -->
- ![img_527](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:10_527.png)
<!-- - `1:25:12`: and one is very often done is that you have a simulator where you yeah have some way or way of basically pretend that you're executing the program on the actual embedded system. -->
- ![img_528](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:20_528.png)
<!-- - `1:25:26`: but of course the capabilities or how much you can trust and abetted simulator is limited why is it limited in this limit because the simulator misses the entire environment so this might be an iota device that sits somewhere. -->
- ![img_529](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:30_529.png)
- ![img_530](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:40_530.png)
<!-- - `1:25:43`: on a tree in yours in your washing machine in your production pipeline but the simulator doesn't have the same inputs the same stimulus from the mound and it's very hard to provide the simulator with the exact same words i would say it's essentially impossible to do this it is possible to some extent but yeah so simulators are good. -->
- ![img_531](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:25:50_531.png)
- ![img_532](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:26:00_532.png)
<!-- - `1:26:03`: for some basic checks to check the execution flow and things are correct on a rather basic level but the entire system you will only see you if you put it into the actual embedded system. -->
- ![img_533](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:26:10_533.png)
<!-- - `1:26:17`: and also debugging and finding bucks in an embedded system is very very complex so what do you usually do as you use a protocol called gtech where you connect your pc over cable with your embedded programmer if your embedded system and this wireless protocol in the debugger you can step through the code to change. -->
- ![img_534](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:26:20_534.png)
- ![img_535](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:26:30_535.png)
<!-- - `1:26:37`: something read out the contents of variables and songs of. -->
- ![img_536](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:26:40_536.png)
<!-- - `1:26:42`: so this is quite different from the way you do suffer development for you or for your own pc if you're just doing some python script for example to generate a plot or whatever those is quite quite different in embedded systems. -->
- ![img_537](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:26:50_537.png)
- ![img_538](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:27:00_538.png)
<!-- - `1:27:01`: and this is one example of an embedded system i have one here so here in on the slide you have the launchpad from texas instruments this is is in development board from nordic. -->
- ![img_539](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:27:10_539.png)
<!-- - `1:27:15`: and. -->
<!-- - `1:27:17`: you don't have to understand everything on a sled what i want to mention is that here on the lower pod this is actually the embedded processor the red one here. -->
- ![img_540](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:27:20_540.png)
<!-- - `1:27:27`: and all the rest on top you have to physical view or. -->
- ![img_541](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:27:30_541.png)
<!-- - `1:27:32`: and yet you have the block diagram all the rest year this processor with all these hybrid components are just there for you to observe what is going on. -->
- ![img_542](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:27:40_542.png)
<!-- - `1:27:45`: on the actual target device so through this chain near you you do the programming you can do the debugging over j take the program over you aren't who can provide the power or switch off the power to test your your system what happens if you turn it on and off. -->
- ![img_543](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:27:50_543.png)
- ![img_544](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:28:00_544.png)
<!-- - `1:28:02`: yeah i saw desert dedicated processor with all kinds of all kinds of peripherals is a very very powerful observer essentially it's an embedded system this year is an embedded system to observe. -->
- ![img_545](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:28:10_545.png)
<!-- - `1:28:17`: the embedded system that you are actually interested in so it's an embedded system in an embedded system and if you'll come tools some of the. -->
- ![img_546](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:28:20_546.png)
<!-- - `1:28:27`: hardly a practicum in the next summer semester or if you do a project with with my group or master's project or whatever you will very likely use one of these boards and you will interact with us at the gym. -->

- ![img_548](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:28:40_548.png)
<!-- - `1:28:40`: i. -->
<!-- - `1:28:42`: yeah saw baby maybe this is a little bit redundant but let me explain again so if if you will take your programs of this your your c c program your job right so the we edited the code your uh hello world the compiler translates into an assembler program you may also add some as. -->
- ![img_549](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:28:50_549.png)
- ![img_550](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:29:00_550.png)
<!-- - `1:29:02`: similar by yourself which we and our group are actually doing very often because we want to make sure that things are as efficient and as as possible. -->
- ![img_551](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:29:10_551.png)
<!-- - `1:29:11`: so you have an assembler program does it translate it into a binary representation and the object fire then a linker connects. -->
- ![img_552](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:29:20_552.png)
<!-- - `1:29:22`: your own program with other libraries operating systems and whatever and lincoln commands which we talk about briefly and then it outputs a file. -->
- ![img_553](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:29:30_553.png)
<!-- - `1:29:32`: that is then programmed into the embedded system into the launchpad for example or into a development kit. -->
- ![img_554](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:29:40_554.png)
<!-- - `1:29:44`: okay so this is maybe a redundant you can have a look at this basically this is what i said with a bit more. -->
- ![img_555](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:29:50_555.png)
<!-- - `1:29:52`: and detail what is maybe worthwhile mentioning is that the linker not only uses the object file and the libraries as input and connects them it also does also link or commands dedicated commands that instruct. -->

<!-- - `1:31:23`: excerpt of an assembler for an arm architecture you may have seen the assembler fall for mips and other architectures of this is for for the arm architecture but it's still quite similar with lord statements compare statements branch statements and your tool things are edited together and so on but. -->

<!-- - `1:35:07`: things are really executed as you want them to be executed so sometimes you mean what you can do as you can you couldn't compile your your c program and then look at the assembler code that was generated by the c compiler. -->

<!-- - `1:35:22`: and sometimes you may find out that what the c compiler did this was not exactly what you wanted the compiler to do. -->

<!-- - `1:35:31`: i mean you can play around with compiler flags and optimization letters i dunno if you are a fan of this but you can influence what the compiler does to some extent but sometimes you will don't want to trust the compiler you'll really want to make sure that that things are being executed as you want them to be eg. -->

<!-- - `1:35:51`: executed and then you you have to write some code and you can also write the self modifying code in assembler so that the code that modifies itself as while it's being executed and this is something that that is typically done in embedded systems with simpler code but this is very very advanced way of. -->

<!-- - `1:36:12`: of programming embedded systems and we have some experience in our group of this but this is not something that you learn typically in intellectual so this something that you might be doing or learning in a in a master's project or at the end of a of a of a master thesis when you really really have to lose. -->

<!-- - `1:36:32`: and yeah but you are usually write assembler only for very small portions of your code like the very critical parts the rest really would like to do in c because otherwise it's just too much effort and too much code to maintain and and and understand so the c code is still much. -->

<!-- - `1:36:51`: and now. -->
<!-- - `1:36:54`: okay so there's another important organizational question maybe not all of you were present at the beginning of of the lecture saw today there will be no exercise so in the morning on tuesdays we will have lecture from eight to ten. -->

- ![img_601](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:37:10_601.png)
<!-- - `1:37:12`: also next week the week after there's a holiday on november first today there will be no lecture in the afternoon so no up nor exercise sorry in the afternoon from twelve to top so you have free time. -->
- ![img_602](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:37:20_602.png)
<!-- - `1:37:27`: next week that will definitely be the electorate in the morning we are not sure yet if we also have the exercise in the afternoon because we have to align the lecture content with the content off of the exercise so please register to the earliest course and have a careful look if there will be an egg. -->

- ![img_604](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:37:40_604.png)
<!-- - `1:37:47`: associates are ready next week and yet just we have to get up to speed with the lecture before we can apply the concepts in the exercise. -->
- ![img_605](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:37:50_605.png)
<!-- - `1:37:58`: i will upload the slides to ileus later today latest by tomorrow and also the recording of today's lecture. -->
- ![img_606](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:38:00_606.png)

<!-- - `1:38:23`: there's a clash. -->
<!-- - `1:38:27`: i'm not sure if we can still do still. -->
- ![img_609](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:38:30_609.png)
<!-- - `1:38:34`: change this and i can check it with misery for moses moses moses if they're still a possibility so let me. -->

<!-- - `1:38:47`: services m s t. -->
- ![img_611](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:38:50_611.png)
<!-- - `1:38:52`: yeah. -->
<!-- - `1:38:54`: no promises but i will check at least if we can switch. -->
- ![img_612](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:39:00_612.png)
<!-- - `1:39:01`: i. -->
<!-- - `1:39:05`: is there a possibility to upload the slides before the lecture as i said in the beginning i'm giving this lecture for the first time now in viborg and i expect to be making changes to the slights until right before so i cannot promise to upload the slides beef beef before before the nature. -->

<!-- - `1:39:24`: okay. -->
<!-- - `1:39:26`: one. -->
- ![img_615](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:39:30_615.png)
<!-- - `1:39:31`: okay so if there any further clashes with lectures and maybe you write a comment on in the forum in the ilias forum maybe this is a better place to collect all the clashes saw also the the person saw who mentioned the clash with in his tea please write it in. -->
- ![img_616](./_Lecture1_imgs/1:39:40_616.png)
<!-- - `1:39:48`: the forum we can have a check but yeah the flexibility in the schedule i think is quite limited at this stage but we we will see there are also plans that i have heard that the how's i the the kino house will be closed from november. -->
